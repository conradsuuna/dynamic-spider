,"Cabbage, Cauliflower, Brussel Sprouts, and Broccoli",,
,"Cabbage, Cauliflower, Brussel Sprouts, and Broccoli",Black Rot," (bacterium – , pv. ,): Infection usually occurs near margins of leaves. Yellow areas develop along the margins, progressing into the leaf in an inverted-V shape. Veins in the affected areas are black. The bacterium may attack cruciferous plants at all stages of growth. A black discoloration is observed in the stem when it is split lengthwise. Cauliflower is very susceptible to black rot and the interior of the stem may be destroyed by secondary soft rot organisms that attack the black rot infection. It is a seed-borne bacterium which can persist in the soil for only a short time. Some wild plants may act as hosts harboring the bacterium while crucifers are absent from commercial fields. Young plants resulting from infected seed serve as a source of secondary infection. Under crowded conditions in the field and during periods of rain, the bacteria spread quickly to nearby healthy plants. Control is achieved by following a 2 year rotation, by planting disease-free seed, and seed that has been treated with hot water to eliminate seed-borne bacteria."
,"Cabbage, Cauliflower, Brussel Sprouts, and Broccoli",Fusarium Yellow," (fungus – , f. sp. ,): The first indication of the disease is the yellowish-green color of the foliage. Plants appear wilted and stunted. Infected plants usually show a curved mid-rib and the leaf grows on only one side. The disease may be easily confused with black rot since many symptoms are similar. The fungus can live in the soil for a number of years without a host plant. It infects plants through young rootlets and wounds caused by transplanting or insects. It develops in the water conducting vessels, causing a brown discoloration similar to that produced by the black rot bacterium. The disease is checked by very cold or very hot soil tempera- ture. Resistant varieties and long rotations will avoid crop loss."
,"Cabbage, Cauliflower, Brussel Sprouts, and Broccoli",Downy Mildew," (fungus – ,): The fungus is more noticeable on the underside of leaves as a gray, fluffy, downy growth in well defined spots. Outer leaves of the head will develop small black spots when infected with the mildew fungus. The fungus overwinters in crop refuse. Sanitation, rotation and spraying with a protective fungicide are the most effective control methods. During periods of high humidity and cool temperature, the fungus is difficult to control and is almost always present in cabbage fields."
,"Cabbage, Cauliflower, Brussel Sprouts, and Broccoli",Black Leg," (fungus – ,): First symptoms occur on leaves and stems as small spots with ashen-gray centers and black dots. The stem lesions gradually enlarge extending to the roots. In advanced stages the root system develops a dry rot. Wilted leaves tend to remain attached to the stem instead of defoliating like plants infected with yellows or black rot. The fungus is carried on seed and can persist on infected plant residue for one or two years. Spread is dependent on dew, rain or irrigation water. Avoid soils where cabbage or related plants were grown within the last four years. Destroy crop residues by shredding and deep burial of crop residue."
,"Cabbage, Cauliflower, Brussel Sprouts, and Broccoli",Powdery Mildew," (fungus – ,): This disease occurs infrequently on cabbage and related plants. A white, powdery growth is observed on the upper surface of leaves. Protective fungicides can be applied if plants become severely infected."
,"Cabbage, Cauliflower, Brussel Sprouts, and Broccoli",Alternaria Leaf Spot," (fungus – ,): The first symptom is a minute dark spot on seedling stems and on the leaves. These spots enlarge and are marked with concentric rings, giving a bull’s eye appearance. The fungus overwinters on cabbage residue or on seed. Spores are disseminated by wind or water. Hot water treatment, as recommended for black rot, will rid the seed of this organism. Fungicide application will prevent the fungus from developing in the field."
,"Cabbage, Cauliflower, Brussel Sprouts, and Broccoli",Rhizoctonia or Wire Stem Disease," (fungus – ,): This disease may appear at different stages of growth. A damping-off phase of the disease will cause young seedlings to die. After seedlings are older, they may be attacked but lesions seldom completely girdle the stems. The infected stems are somewhat smaller than normal and are tough and woody. Older plants can also be attached causing a head rot or a root rot. The causal agent is a common soilborne fungus that attacks many plants. Crop rotation and planting healthy transplants are the most effective means of control."
,"Cabbage, Cauliflower, Brussel Sprouts, and Broccoli",Internal Tip Burn, (physiological): Tip burn causes leaf margins to turn brown. The leaves are buried in the head. Exact nature of the problem has been associated with poor water movement within the plant.
,"Cabbage, Cauliflower, Brussel Sprouts, and Broccoli",Soft Rot," (bacterium – ,): Soft rot also occurs most commonly when fields become water saturated. Stems become decayed and have a foul odor. During storage and transit, a slimy decay with a foul odor develops. The disease begins in areas that have been bruised, particularly during periods of high temperature and humidity prevail. Proper handling during harvesting, packaging and storing along with keeping temperatures low are the best means of control. Follow a long rotation and plant on raised beds in well drained soil to prevent field infections."
,"Cabbage, Cauliflower, Brussel Sprouts, and Broccoli",Cabbage Mosaic, (virus): Leaves display green and yellow mottled areas. Leaf veins may be lighter in color. Keeping fields and surrounding areas free of weed hosts will help reduce the disease.
,"Cabbage, Cauliflower, Brussel Sprouts, and Broccoli",Root Knot Nematode:," (,)"
,"Cabbage, Cauliflower, Brussel Sprouts, and Broccoli",Southern Blight:," (,)"
,Beet (table),Cercospora Leaf Spot ,"(fungus – ,): Cercospora leaf spot causes small, brown lesions with reddish-purple borders. As the spots enlarge, the center becomes gray with purple borders. Severe infection causes the leaves to drop. Crop residue should be plowed under. High humidity and temperatures around 75 to 80 degrees F are optimum for fungal growth. Foliar sprays with a preventative fungicide should be applied when symptoms first appear."
,Beet (table),Curly Top," (virus): Plants infected with curly top die prematurely. Young leaves roll inward and eventually turn yellow and die. (See section on ,)"
,Beet (table),Mosaic ,(virus): Leaves appear puckered and mottled with light and dark green areas. Plants are stunted. Chlorosis occurs on infected leaves.
,Beet (table),Powdery Mildew," (fungus – ,): This is a relatively new disease of both sugar and table beets. Infected leaves are covered by a white, powdery fungal growth. Affected leaves turn red. Sulfur-containing fungicides are recommended."
,Beet (table),Root Knot Nematodes,": (See ,)"
,Beet (table),Southern Blight,": (See ,)"
,"Bean (Snap, Lima, and Butter Beans)",Bacterial Blights:," , (bacterium – ,); Common Blight (bacterium – ,): Plants infected with the halo blight bacterium form greenish-yellow circles around each lesion. Interior of the lesion turns brown. With age, lesions enlarge and coalesce. The entire leaf finally drops. Stem lesions appear as long, reddish colored spots. When the plant begins to set fruit, lesions are formed at the nodes which girdle the stem. This reduces fruit development. Common blight-infected pods do not exhibit the greenish-yellow halo around the lesion like halo blight lesions. Infected leaves with halo blight turn yellow and slowly die while those with common blight turn brown and drop quickly. Both organisms are seed-borne. Entry into the plant is through the leaf stomata. Rain and damp weather encourage development of these diseases. Common blight is more of a problem in warm weather while halo blight is favored by cool temperatures. Both bacteria can live in the soil for two years on plant residue. To control bacterial blight of beans, seed grown in the western United States should be planted. Avoid spreading the disease by not entering the field when the foliage is wet. Follow a three year rotation."
,"Bean (Snap, Lima, and Butter Beans)",Anthracnose ,"(fungus – ,): This is a seed-borne fungus which attacks all above ground portions of the plant. Infected seed are marked by dark, sunken lesions that extend through the seed coat. Stem lesions are oval and sunken. The center of the lesion is dark brown with purplish to red borders. In early stages, the fungus develops along the veins and becomes purplish to red in color. In advanced stages, leaves become ragged. Infection of the pods results in small, reddish, elongated spots. Older spots are sunken and have brown to reddish-brown borders. The disease is favored by cool, wet springs and falls. It disappears during hot, dry summers. The fungus can survive in the soil for two years in plant debris. Control is obtained by: (1) the use of disease-free seed, (2) crop rotation, (3) not entering fields when plants are wet, and (4) spraying with fungicides."
,"Bean (Snap, Lima, and Butter Beans)",Cercospora Leaf Spot," (fungi – ,): Lower foliage becomes marked by irregular tan spots one-eighth to one-fourth inch in diameter. Severe infection causes defoliation and plant stunting. It is reported to attack the pod but has only been observed on foliage in Texas. Infection is most severe during periods of extended rainfall, high humidity and temperatures between 75 to 85 degrees F. No resistance exists among varieties. Fungicide sprays should begin at first sign of disease and continued during cool, rainy conditions."
,"Bean (Snap, Lima, and Butter Beans)",Root Rot," (fungus – ,): Bean seed may rot in soil or the young seedling may become stunted. A reddish-brown canker is formed on the stem. Cankers may completely girdle the stem or may only partially girdle it, causing severe stunting. Beans should be planted after the soil has warmed to above 69 degreesF. Beans should follow a grass type crop."
,"Bean (Snap, Lima, and Butter Beans)",Fusarium Root Rot," (fungus – ,): Plants infected with Fusarium are characterized by a reddish discoloration of the tap root. Affected plants are stunted with yellow leaves. Young rootlets formed in the area of the lesion are killed. If weather conditions are favorable, a normal crop may be produced. Avoid soils where Fusarium has been a problem. Long rotations (four to five years) will help reduce losses."
,"Bean (Snap, Lima, and Butter Beans)",Pod Blight," (fungus – ,): Pod blight of lima beans is first observed as brown pustules of irregular shape on the leaves. Lesions grow to one-fourth to three-fourths of an inch in diameter. During the latter part of the growing season, the fungus spreads to nearby pods, where it causes a pale watery spot. The spot enlarges and becomes darker with age. On pods the spot is marked by dark brown to black pustules on the surface arranged in a ring."
,"Bean (Snap, Lima, and Butter Beans)",,
,"Bean (Snap, Lima, and Butter Beans)",Mosaic ,(virus): Leaves become puckered and mottled with light and dark-green areas. Infected plants become stunted. The virus is seed-borne and can be spread by aphids. Losses can be reduced by growing resistant varieties and following an approved aphid control program.
,"Bean (Snap, Lima, and Butter Beans)",Curly Top ,(virus): Infected plants are stunted and have distorted foliage. It is spread by the beet leafhopper. Use resistant varieties and practice good insect control.

,"Bean (Snap, Lima, and Butter Beans)",Cotton Root Rot:," (,)"
,"Bean (Snap, Lima, and Butter Beans)",Sun Scald: ,"In the early spring beans are often affected by a condition in which the young leaves turn light tan in color and die. This may happen to the entire leaf or to only a portion of the leaf. The conditions favoring disease development are cool to moderate temperatures, extended periods of high humidity, and cloudy days followed by a bright sunny day. Damage is usually restricted to only a few scattered leaves."
,"Bean (Snap, Lima, and Butter Beans)",Rust ,"(fungus – ,): Small reddish-brown pustules form on lower side of leaves. The fungus overwinters in crop residue. If rust has been severe, a rotation program should be practiced. Resistant varieties should be used when past experience indicates rust to be a problem. Apply approved fungicides at first sign of infection in the fall."
,"Bean (Snap, Lima, and Butter Beans)",Powdery Mildew," (fungus – ,): Powdery mildew is character- ized by a white powdery growth on the foliage. Infected pods and foliage become malformed. The fungal spores are spread by wind. Spray with approved fungicides. Powdery mildew seldom becomes an economic problem."
,"Bean (Snap, Lima, and Butter Beans)",Watery Soft Rot," (fungus – ,): The fungus affects the stems, leaves and pods of beans. First signs of infection are small, soft, watery spots that enlarge rapidly under cool, moist conditions. They may enlarge and coalesce and the stem is girdled. Infected pods turn into a soft, watery mass. Following the watery stage the affected tissues dry out and turn brown. Within a short time the brown areas are covered with a dense white fungal growth. With age, the white fungal growth turns gray and is dotted with small, hard black bodies called sclerotia. Most losses occur in shipping. Infected beans tend to stick together."

,Pecan,Scab,"Small, circular, olive-green to black spots form on the lower surface of the leaf and nuts. These spots may have a velvety or cracked appearance. Sometimes these spots coalesce forming large, irregularly shaped darkened areas. On nuts, these spots appear to be sunken in. Infected twigs will exhibit elongated spots parallel to the twig axis. Infected foliage may prematurely drop. When infection is severe, the entire nut surface is black, development is arrested and the nut drops prematurely or fails to grow in the area of infection."
,Pecan,Brown Leaf Spot,"Circular, reddish brown spots form on the upper and lower leaf surface. Older spots will turn gray and concentric circles will form within the spot. If the disease is not controlled the tree will lose its leaves. "
,Pecan,Vein Spot,"Smooth, dark brown to black spots form on the vascular structures of the leaf which include: veins, midribs, petioles, and rachises. In the sun, these spots appear greasy or shiny. Premature defoliation will occur. This infection often resembles pecan scab lesions."
,Pecan,Leaf Blotch,"Faint yellow spots develop on the upper leaf surface; these spots eventually turn dark brown. Small, olive-green spots with a velvety appearance form on the lower leaf surface. Premature defoliation may occur. "
,Pecan,Crown Gall,"Woody tumors or galls form on the base of the trunk and root tissue. If the gall girdles the trunk or main roots, the tree may be killed."
,Pecan,Downy Spot,"Circular, light yellow spots form on the lower leaf surface. These spots may be covered with a white fuzzy growth. As the disease progresses, these spots become visible on the upper leaf surface. The upper leaf surface spots are yellow, while the lower leaf surface spots turn golden brown. Premature defoliation may occur."
,Pecan,Powdery Mildew,A white powdery growth develops on infected nut shucks and leaves.
,Pecan,Pecan Bacterial Leaf Scorch (BLS),Brown to tan dead spots form on the margin or at the tip of the leaf. A distinct dark brown line separates the dead tissue from the living tissue. Eventually the whole leaf will turn brown and die. Premature defoliation will occur.
,Pecan,Bunch Disease,"Trees affected with bunch disease show a typical bunching symptom, caused by excessive growth of lateral buds. This results in a dense growth of thin shoots and leaves that resembles a witches’ broom. "
,Pecan,Parasitic and Epiphytic Plants,"Gray to green plant that typically forms crustlike, leaflike, or branching growth on trees.,A l,ong, whisker-like plant that hangs from trees.,It first occurs as small, gray green tufts that develop within a relatively short time into a dense “ball” composed of numerous individual plants. The plants form root-like holdfasts which penetrate into the rough bark of the tree. These holdfasts often completely encircle a limb."
,Pecan,Articularia Leaf Mold,A growth of white tufts develops on the lower leaf surface. 
,Pecan,Pink Mold,"Pink mold will develop on nuts that are infected with the pecan scab fungus. A white to pink, moldy growth will develop in old scab lesions. If the fungus invades the kernel, it becomes oily and produces a rancid odor. "
,Pecan,Cotton Root Rot,"Infected trees die suddenly. Root bark is decayed and brownish, and bronze colored wooly strands of the fungus are frequently visble on the root surface. Leaves will turn yellow or brown and will remain attached to the tree."
,Pecan,Shuck Decline (Shuck Dieback),"A dark, thin line forms on the inner surface of the shuck, at the junction with the shell. The inside of the shuck turns dark green and slimy and the dark, thin line progresses toward the exterior. The outer surface of the shuck has a shiny, water-soaked appearance. Beginning at the distal end, the shuck turns brown and then eventually black. The shuck may peal back at the distal end, resembling a tulip."
,Pecan,Shuck and Kernel Rot,Fruit rot begins at the stem end of the fruit and progresses to the tip of the shuck rapidly. The shuck will turn black and become soft and moist. Kernels are inedible.
,Pecan,Stem-End Blight,"Black, sunken, shiny spots form at or near the stem-end of the shuck. As the spots enlarge, the shuck will be completely black and the liquid in the kernel turns brown. "
,Pecan,Root Knot Nematode,"Feed on the inside of the roots inducing knots or galls on them. These swellings are usually white and round to irregularly elongated. Foliage may wilt, appear stunted, and turn yellow or bronze."
,Pecan,Kernel Discoloration,Kernels develop dark spots and may become rotted. Stinkbugs can also cause dark brown to black spots on the kernels. 
,Pecan,Fungal Twig Dieback,Infected branches are covered with small raised pustules with black centers. 
,Rice,Bacterial Leaf Blight," (bacterium – , pv ,: This disease was identified for the first time in Texas in 1987. The disease is very destructive in Asia, but at this time it appears that the strain of the bacterium in Texas is not very aggressive and causes negligible losses. The first symptom of the disease is a water soaked lesion on the edges of the leaf blades near the leaf tip. The lesions expand and turn yellowish and eventually grayish-white. High rainfall with strong winds are thought thought to provide conditions for the bacteria to multiply and enter the leaf through injured tissue. The bacterium has been isolated from clubhead grass (,) collected form rice fields in Texas. Fall plowing or rolling of stubble to hasten decay of the rice debris should help to manage the disease by destroying the tissue in which the bacterium is maintained."
,Rice,Black Sheath Rot," (fungus – , var. ,): Black sheath rot or crown rot was considered a minor disease of rice in Texas for several decades, but has become increasing important with increasing intensive production systems. The fungus attacks the crown, lower leaf sheaths, and roots of the rice plant causing a dark brown to black discoloration of the leaf sheaths from the crown to considerably above the water line. As the discolored, infected sheaths decay, tiny, black, fungal reproductive structures (perithecia) form within the tissue and can be seen with a hand lens. The disease is usually observed late in the main crop season and may cause reduced tillering, poor grain fill, and lodging. Crop rotation with non-grass crops and thorough discing and maintenance of a clean fallow field from the summer prior to planting rice will help control the disease by destroying plant residue and weed host upon which the pathogen survives."
,Rice,Brown Leaf Spot," (fungus – ,): This disease, previously called Helminthosporium leaf spot, is common in Texas. Most conspicuous symptoms of the disease occur on leaves and glumes of maturing plants. Symptoms also appear on young seedlings and the panicle branches in older plants. Brown leaf spot is a seed-borne disease. Leaf spots may be evident shortly after seedling emergence and continue to develop until maturity. Leaf spots vary in size, are typically 1/8 inch in diameter, and are circular to oval in shape. The smaller spots are dark brown to reddish brown, and the larger spots have a darkbrown margin and reddish brown to gray centers. Damage from brown spot is particularly noticeable when the crop is produced in nutritionally deficient or otherwise unfavorable soil conditions. Significant development of brown spot is often indicative of a soil fertility problem. Brown spot may be reduced by balanced fertilization, crop rotation, and the use of high quality planting seed. Foliar fungicides are not economical for controlling brown leaf spot on most commercial long grain varieties. Rice seed with infected glumes can result in diseased seedlings. Seed treatment fungicides reduce the incidence and severity of seedling blight caused by this fungus."
,Rice,Blast ,"(fungus – ,): This disease can cause serious losses to susceptible varieties during periods of blast favorable weather. Depending on the part of the plant affected, the disease is often called leaf blast, rotten neck, or panicle blast. The fungus produces spots or lesions on leaves, nodes, panicles, and collar of the flag leaves. Leaf lesions range from somewhat diamondshaped to elongated with tapered, pointed ends. The center of the spot is usually gray and the margin brown or reddish-brown. Both the shape and color of the spots may vary and resemble those of the brown leaf spot disease. Blast differs from brown leaf spot in that it causes longer lesions and develops more rapidly. The blast fungus frequently attacks the node at the base of the panicle and the branches of the panicle. If the panicle is attacked early in its development, the grain on the lower portion of the panicle may be blank giving the head a bleached whitish color, giving the term “blasted” head or rice “blast”. If the node at the base of the panicle is infected, the panicle breaks causing the “rotten neck” condition. In addition, the fungus may also attack the nodes or joints of the stem. When a node is infected, the sheath tissue rots and the part of the stem above the point of infection often is killed. In some cases, the node is weakened to the extent that the stem will break causing extensive lodging. Blast generally occurs scattered throughout a field rather than in a localized area of the field. Late planting, frequent showers, overcast skies, and warm weather favor development of blast. Spores of the fungus are produced in great abundance on blast lesions and can become airborne, disseminating the fungus a considerable distance. High nitrogen fertilization should be avoided in areas that have a history of blast. Control measures include early planting, avoiding excessive or high levels of nitrogen, proper flood management, resistant varieties, and fungicides. Varietal resistance is the most effective method of controlling rice blast. Some foliar fungicides can reduce the incidence of blast, but severe losses can occur on susceptible varieties even when fungicides are applied."
,Rice,Kernel Smut," (fungus – Neovossia barclayana): This disease causes losses in both yield and quality. The endosperm of the grain is attacked by the fungus causing either part or all of the starchy material to be replaced by a black mass of smut spores. The fungus does not destroy the seed embryo, and the diseased seed will germinate even if all the endosperm has been replaced. Release of the smut spores from within the kernel will cause a discoloration of hulls. Moisture causes the dark mass of spores to swell and break out of the hull. Smut is easily detected after a rain or in the early morning following a heavy dew. Kernel smut is usually most severe on late planted rice. Usually, only a small percent of the kernels are affected, but monetary losses can be significant because of penalties levied on the grain at the dryer. Milled rice has a dull or grayish appearance when smutted grains are present in the sample. High rates of nitrogen increase the incidence of smut. Varieties differ in the incidence of smut observed in commercial plantings. Less smut is detected in most commercial semi-dwarf varieties. Control measures include the use of semi-dwarf varieties in fields with a history of smut and to reduce reduce nitrogen rates and floodwater depths in fields where very susceptible varieties must be grown. The fungicide propiconazole is effective in suppressing kernel smut."
,Rice,Leaf Smut," (fungus – ,): This is a minor fungal disease in which small slightly raised black spots develop primarily on the leaves. Raised spots or pustules break open releasing air-borne spores. Infection is often heavy enough to kill tips of leaves. Leaf smut occurs late in the growing season and causes little or no economic loss. No control measures are recommended."
,Rice,Narrow Brown Leaf Spot," (fungus – ,): The disease varies in severity from year to year and usually becomes most severe as rice approaches maturity, causing premature ripening and yield reduction. Leaf spots are long (1/10 to 1/2 inch), narrow (1/32 inch), and cinnamon-brown. Premature leaf death will occur in severe cases. Late in the growing season, the fungus often attacks the sheath of the flag leaf causing the “brown blotch” or “net blotch” phase of the disease in which a large (1 1/2 to 3 inch long) cinnamon brown lesion is formed and typically encircles the uppermost internode about an inch below the the base of the panicle. Early maturing varieties tend to escape the major impact of the disease. There are differences in suseptibility among some rice varieties, however, due to buildup of certain races of the fungus, resistance does not remain reliable. Some foliar fungicides effectively suppress this disease and may be economical if other diseases are also controlled along with the narrow brown leaf spot."
,Rice,Seedling Blight and Seed Decay," (fungus – , sp., , sp. and ,):  Seedling diseases cause spotty, irregular stands through seed decay,  pre-emergence and post emergence disease. Seedling disease complex  results from activity of various kinds of fungi, most of which grow on  the kernels or hulls of seed rice or on soil organic matter. Fungi enter  germinating rice seed or young seedlings and either injure or kill  them. If infected seedlings emerge from the soil, they often die. Those  that manage to survive are weakened and chlorotic in appearance. Damage  is most severe on early seeded rice (late February and March) and deeply  planted rice. Control measures include the use of high quality seed, an  approved seed treatment, shallow seeding of early planted rice, and  planting into warm soil."
,Rice,Sheath Blight," (fungus – ,): Sheath blight  is perhaps the most important disease of rice in Texas. Initial  symptoms usually develop as lesions on sheaths of lower leaves near the  water line when plants are in the late tillering or early internode  elongation stage of growth (approximately 10 – 15 days after flooding).  These lesions usually develop just below the leaf collar as  oval-to-elliptical, green-gray, water-soaked spots about 1/4 inch wide  and 1/2 to 1 1/4 inch long. With age, the lesions expand and the center  of the lesions may become bleached with an irregular tan-to-brown  border. When humidity exceeds 95 percent and temperatures are in the  range of 85-90 degrees F, infection spreads rapidly by means of runner  hyphae to upper plant parts, including leaf blades, causing extensive,  tan, irregularly shaped lesions with brown borders. Disease development  progresses very rapidly in the early heading and grain filling growth  stages during periods of frequent rainfall and overcast skies. Plants  heavily infected at these stages produce poorly filled grain,  particularly in the lower portion of the panicle. Additional losses  result from increased lodging or reduced ratoon production due to  infection of the culm and reduced carbohydrate reserves. As plants  senesce from maturity, lesions will dry and become grayishwhite to tan  with brownish borders. Sclerotia, initially white but turning dark brown  at maturity, are produced superficially on or near the lesions.  Sclerotia are loosely attached and easily dislodge from the plant.  Sclerotia are the primary means for fungus survival between crops. They  survive long periods in the soil and will float to the surface of  flooded rice fields in the subsequent rice crop, infect rice plants at  the waterline and continue the disease cycle. Sclerotia can survive from  one to several years in the soil. They can also attack several weed  hosts and cause infection. New varieties and changing cultural practices  often combine many of the factors that favor disease development. In  recent years, the wide acceptance of susceptible varieties, because of  their high yielding potential, has contributed greatly to the rapid  increase in sheath blight. In addition, the new varieties respond to  heavy nitrogen applications in order to achieve their high yielding  potential. Heavy applications of nitrogen predispose susceptible plants  to attack by the sheath blight organism. Rotation with susceptible  crops, such as soybean (see Soybean Aerial Blight) can also in crease  the severity of sheath blight in succeeding rice crops. Disease  incidence may be reduced by planting less susceptible varieties. None of  the long grain varieties currently grown in Texas show adequate field  resistance. Excessive seeding rates and high nitrogen applications  should be avoided in fields with a history of the disease. Grass and  weeds should be controlled. Long-term rotations may reduce the incidence  of sheath blight, but soybeans, sorghum, and many weeds are susceptible  to , Excessive seeding rates and thick plant  populations favor sheath blight development. In some cases, foliar  fungicides may be economical for reducing sheath blight losses."
,Rice,Stem Rot," (fungus – ,): Stem rot becomes  most noticeable in rice fields during the latter stages of maturity.  The disease occurs in circular to irregular areas in fields and causes  premature death and lodging of the plants. The fungus attacks the rice  plant near the water line usually during late tillering or early  reproductive stages of growth. It first causes black, rectangular  lesions with distinct angular borders on the leaf sheath. Later the  lesions become larger, more diffuse, irregular in shape, and penetrate  deep into the culm. As rice approaches maturity, injury to the stems  increases and reaches its peak at harvest. Weakened stalks break during  this stage and plants lodge making harvest difficult. Plants infected  early yield poorly. Ratoon cropping in many areas is impractical because  of the high percentage of plants killed by the disease. Diagnosis is  confirmed by obtaining an infected plant, splitting the base of the  stem, and observing the presence of tiny, black sclerotia in internal  stem tissues. Control measures include the following: crop rotation, use  of early maturing varieties, fluctuating the flood water level,  avoiding excessive rates of nitrogen, and rice stubble destruction. Some  fungicides help to suppress this disease but are not highly effective."
,Rice,Straighthead," (physiological disorder): Straighthead is a physiological disorder that  causes the entire head to be blank and remain upright at maturity.  Straighthead generally occurs in spots scattered throughout a field and  is most easily recognized near harvest when normal plants have  downturned heads (from the weight of the grain in the panicle). The  disease is frequently found on sandy loam soils but seldom on clay  soils. Old cotton fields with arsenic residues can have a severe  incidence of straighthead. Other, as yet unknown, soil factors are also  involved in causing straighthead. Often it is found in fields where  excessive non-decayed vegetation has been plowed under just before  planting. The disease is characterized by upright heads when the rice  matures due to infertile seed. Hulls may be distorted into a crescent  shape or “parrot beak”. One or both hulls may be missing. Affected  plants continue to grow, are a darker green, and often produce shoots  from a lower portion of the plant. First year crops of rice grown on  “new ground” are more likely to be affected. Some varieties are more  tolerant than others. Control measures include planting resistant  varieties and draining fields with a history of the disorder just prior  to internode elongation."
,Grain Sorghum,Anthracnose," (fungus – ,): The anthracnose fungus damages foliage and stems of grain sorghum. On susceptible hybrids, the stem holding the head (peduncle) becomes infected and a brown sunken area with distinct margins develops. When infected stems are cut lenghtwise with a knife, one can see that the fungus has penetrated the soft pith tissue and caused brick-red discolorations. This peduncle infection inhibits the flow of water and nutrients to the grain causing poor grain development. The fungus also invades individual grains and the small branches of the panicle. Rapid and severe yield loss can result from panicle and peduncle infections. Leaf lesions are small, elliptical to circular, usually less than 3/8-inch in diameter. These spots develop small, circular, straw-colored centers with wide margins that may vary in color from reddish to tan to blackish purple. The spots may coalesce to form larger areas of infected tissue. In Texas, anthracnose is restricted mostly to the gulf coast areas. The use of resistant hybrids and good management of crop residue are effective control measures."
,Grain Sorghum,Covered Kernel Smut," (fungus – ,): This smut disease was once quite destructive but is seldom seen now because most seed is chemically treated. The disease destroys all kernels in a head and replaces them with a cone-shaped gall or may affect only portions of a panicle. At harvest time, these galls are broken and spores contaminate the outer surface of other kernels. This disease is controlled by use of chemical seed treatment, use of clean seed and planting resistant hybrids."
,Grain Sorghum,Fusarium Stalk Rot," (fungus – ,): Like charcoal rot, , stalk rot usually develops on mature to nearly mature plants that have been subjected to some form of stress. Infection takes place at the base of the plant and produces discoloration in the stalk. When shredding of the vascular area occurs from this organism, black fungal bodies (sclerotia) are not present as they are with charcoal rot. Avoiding stress problems by proper use of cultural practices is the best approach to control."
,Grain Sorghum,Maize Dwarf Mosaic Virus (MDMV),": maize dwarf mosaic is a virus disease that occurs over all the sorghum producing areas of Texas. Its ability to cause damage is dependent on the presence of an overwintering virus host (mainly Johnsongrass), aphid populations to facilitate virus transmission and the susceptibility of the hybrid being grown. Affected plants have mottled (light green blotchiness) terminal leaves. These alternate light- and darker-green areas in the leaf can be more easily seen when held between the viewer and a light source. Observers should always look at the newest leaves for the most severe symptoms. Highly susceptible hybrids are stunted with chlorotic symptoms in the upper leaves and suffer significant yield losses. Some hybrids produce a red leaf symptom when plants are infected and when night temperatures are below 55 degrees F. Use tolerant hybrids and control Johnsongrass in and around the field to manage this disease."
,Grain Sorghum,Seed Rots and Seedling Diseases," (fungi – , sp., , sp. and others): Seed rots and seedling diseases are more prevalent when seed is planted in cool, wet soils, and especially when packing rains seal the soil surface. Seedling emergence and growth is slowed under such conditions, and several soil-borne fungi are able to infect the tender seedlings. Other factors such as poor seed quality or improperly placed fertilizer or herbicide often contribute to the problem. Continuous growth of one crop over a period of years may favor buildup of organisms that cause seedling disease. Use of high quality seed treated with a recommended seed protectant is important. Precision planting to insure proper depth in a well-prepared seedbed is very helpful."
,Grain Sorghum,Bacterial Stripe," (bacterium – ,): This is the most common bacterial disease of sorghum. The disease is characterized by long narrow stripes that vary from red to black depending on the type of sorghum. These stripes are confined between the veins and may have a crusty surface when the bacterial slime dries on the surface. This disease has not been a serious enough problem to warrant specific control in Texas."
,Grain Sorghum,Bacterial Streak," (bacterium – ,): Streak first appears as dark-green watersoaked tissue between veins that later turns brown with red margins. Control measures have not been warranted."
,Grain Sorghum,Bacterial Spot," (bacterium – ,): Spots first appear as watersoaked, green areas on lower leaves before infection spreads to upper leaves. Spots later turn tan with reddish borders. Small lesions are often red throughout. Control measures are not usually necessary."
,Grain Sorghum,Crazy Top Downy Mildew," (fungus – ,): This fungal disease can be troublesome in low lying areas that become flooded. Infected plants have thick, stiff, twisted, pale green leaves with bumpy surfaces. The leaves often turn downward, and the plants produce many shoots or suckers giving a bunchy appearance. Infected plants do not produce heads or produce a proliferation of leafy tissue in place of the head. Wild and cultivated grasses can serve as sources of inoculum. There are differences in susceptibility among grain sorghum hybrids but these differences are not significant. Installing drainage structures and diverting water movement to avoid flooding is the most reasonable suggestion for control at this time."
,Grain Sorghum,Head Smut," (fungus – ,): This disease is characterized by the large, dark-brown smut galls that emerge in place of the panicle . The gall is first covered with a whitish membrane which soon breaks and allows spores to be scattered by the wind. Plants become infected while in the seedling stage but evidence of infection is not apparent until heading time. The smut gall produces thousands of spores which become soil-borne and initiate systemic infection of seedlings in subsequent years. Different races of the fungus exist which may result in a sorghum hybrid being resistant in one area but not another. New sources of resistance have been found and growers should utilize resistant hybrids to avoid losses from this disease."
,Grain Sorghum,Root Rot Complex," (fungi – ,, , sp. and others): Several fungi are involved in producing a root rot condition of grain sorghum. One or more of the causal fungi may be involved depending on conditions and organisms present in the soil. Each organism produces distinct symptoms, but identification becomes more complex when other factors are involved. Rotation with non-related crops will lower the population of pathogenic organisms present in the soil."
,Grain Sorghum,Sorghum Downy Mildew," (fungus – ,): Young, systemically infected plants have light green to yellowish stripes lengthwise in the leaves often with a grayish-white downy fungal growth consisting of numerous tiny spores on the lower surface of the leaf opposite the pale striped areas. Soil-borne spores cause systemic infection of the young seedlings. These systemically infected plants will not produce heads. Later infections may parially or completely inhibit grain formation. Plants can also be infected by air-borne spores from the underside of infected leaves. These infections result in localized leaf lesions. Grain sorghum hybrids vary considerably in their susceptibility. Growers should select adapted, high producing hybrids that have resistance to this fungus. Growing highly susceptible grain or forage sorghum builds up populations of the organism in soil, making the problem more severe even in resistant hybrids. Use seed treated with a systemic fungicide containing metalaxyl and resistant hybrids to control this disease."
,Grain Sorghum,Charcoal Rot," (fungus – ,): Grain sorghum plants affected by the charcoal rot fungus fail to fill grain properly and may lodge in the latter part of the season. Infected stalks show an internal shredding at and above the ground line. This can be observed by splitting the stalk and noting the deteriorated soft pith tissue leaving the tougher vascular strands. Fungal structures (sclerotia) can be observed in the affected tissue which appears as though it has been dusted with black pepper. Another type of stalk rot (, sp. and , sp.) may show the shredded condition but the black specks (sclerotia) will be lacking. Conditions under which charcoal rot is favored include stressful hot soil tempertures and low soil moisture during the postflowering period. Host plants are usually in the early-milk to late-dough stage when infection occurs. The fungus is common and widely distributed in nature. Avoiding moisture stress, proper management of crop residue, crop rotation, avoiding excessive plant populations, balancing nitrogen and potassium fertility levels, and growing drought-tolerant, lodging-resistant hybrids represent the best means of control."
,Grain Sorghum,Foliage Diseases Caused by Fungi,: A number of fungal organisms cause foliage infection and may become severe under certain conditions. Occurrence has seldom been consistent or damaging enough to warrant the development of specific control practices. No fungicides have been cleared for use on sorghum foliage. Hybrids vary in their susceptibility to these diseases and resistance is available if their occurrence becomes a problem.
,Grain Sorghum,Loose Kernel Smut," (fungus – ,): Galls formed by loose kernel smut are long and pointed and the thin membrane covering them usually breaks soon after galls reach full size. This disease presents no immediate problem because the control measures mentioned for covered kernel smut have virtually eliminated occurrence of this disease."
,Grain Sorghum,Rust," (fungus – ,): Rust appears on leaves as small raised pustules or blisters that rupture and release many reddish-brown spores. These pustules occur on both the upper and lower leaf surfaces. This disease usually appears when plants near maturity and infection is confined primarily to mature leaves. Grain yield losses are usually not serious and occurrence of the disease is sporadic. Forage sorghum yields may be affected most. The rust fungus also attacks Johnsongrass and overwinters on this host in southern production areas."
,Wheat,Common (dry land) Root Rot," (fungus – ,): The fungus infects the sub-crown internode of young wheat seedlings. Root rotting can continue throughout the season and is most severe when new root formation is slowed. Later in the season, drought and warm temperatures favor root rot. Seed treatment and balanced fertility programs can reduce disease severity. Crop rotation may also reduce the disease and Common root rot is widely distributed in Texas."
,Wheat,Leaf Blotch," (fungus – ,): Lesions appear as pale green to yellow spots on the leaf. As cells in the spot are killed it turns brown. Lesions also appear on the head (see illustration). Later, gray to black fruiting bodies are formed in the dead spot. Control with sanitation (early plowing) and crop rotation."
,Wheat,Stem Rust," (fungus – , f. sp. ,): Stem rust is recognized by the elongated, ragged pustules it produces on stem, leaf, sheath, blade, chaff, beard and occasionally on young kernels. Fragments of epidermis adhere to the sides and ends of the pustules, giving a ragged appearance. The brick-red color and large elongated pustules distinguish it from leaf rust which has small round pustules and orange-red spores. Stem rust is far more devastating than leaf fust on susceptible varieties. Soft wheat varieties are generally more susceptible than hard red winter wheat varieties. Barley, rye, wild barley, and goatgrass are also susceptible."
,Wheat,Take All," (fungus – , var. ,): Take-all is most obvious near heading on plants growing in moist soil. Diseased plants have basal internodes that are shiny black and have few tillers. Heads ripen prematurely and are bleached white and sterile. Plants may break free at the crown when pulled from soil. The fungus causing take-all persists in infected wheat stubble. Take-all is favored by alkaline, compacted, infertile (esp. nitrogen and phosphorus-deficient) and poorly drained soils. The disease has only been observed in Texas under irrigated conditions on the High Plains and Rolling Plains. Rotation may reduce disease incidence in fields where take-all has been a problem."
,Wheat,Soil-borne Mosaic," (virus): Symptoms of soil-borne mosaic appear early in the spring, usually when weather is cool and damp, but are rarely seen in fall or winter. Fields observed from a distance have irregular patches of light green or yellow plants. Symptoms on plant leaves range from mild green to yellow mottling and striping, giving the mosaic appearance. Stunting varies from moderate to severe and may be accomplished by rosetting. Symptom expression favors temperatures below 68, F. Symptoms gradually disappear before harvest time if normal temperature persists. A soil-borne fungus, ,, which is a parasite of roots of many grass plants, is the vector of this disease. Virus particles are either inside spores of the fungus or are attached to the spores. The fungus invades the roots in the fall, when soils are cool and wet, carrying the virus particles with it. There is no practical way to rid the soil of the soil-borne mosaic virus. Rotation out of wheat to other crops will reduce losses."
,Wheat,Foot Rot," (fungi – , spp.): Foot rot generally begins as an invasion of seedling roots. Foot rots are favored by cool temperatures. The fungus is more a secondary invader of roots initially infected by the common root rot fungus. The fungus surviving on crop residues and rotation may reduce disease severity."
,Wheat,Leaf Rust," (fungus – ,): Leaf rust occurs on either side of the leaf and on the leaf sheath as small, reddish-orange pustules. In most years, leaf rust causes more damage in Texas than any other wheat disease. Growth is rapid between 59 – 72, F. It causes a reduction in the number and size of kernels. The disease reduces forage production in fields where it is utilized for grazing. New races of the rust fungus originate naturally and challenge wheat varieties. The leaf rust fungus of wheat does not attack oats or barley."
,Wheat,Powdery Mildew," (fungus – , f. sp. ,): Powdery mildew is usuall found only on the leaves, but the fungus may attack all aboveground parts of the plant. It is noticeable first as small, irregular or circular, light gray spots on the upper surface of a leaf. The spots enlarge as the fungus grows and often may involve large parts of the leaf. As the spots age, the fungus on them takes on a flowery appearance which is due to the production of an enormous number of spores. Often the lower surface of the leaf beneath the diseased spots turns yellow and older parts of the spots turn brown. Affected leaves become deformed and crinkled and in severe cases they become brittle or they may die prematurely. As affected wheat approaches maturity, small, black fruiting structures (seen as black specks) may be scattered throughout the fungus growth on infected spots. This disease is not seed-borne but can be soil-borne. Close grazing to keep top growth reduced to a minimum will allow sunlight and air to keep the crown of the plant dried out, thus reducing the occurrence of powdery mildew. Rotations with non-host plants will also help reduce the soil-borne phase of this disease."
,Wheat,Stinking Smut or Bunt," (fungus – ,): Heads affected by stinking smut fungus have a distinct blue cast. At bloom time infected heads are more slender than healthy heads and do not put out pollen sacks. At maturity they appear plumper but lighter in weight than normal heads. The smut ball consists of a mass of foul-smelling, dark-brown powder (spores of the stinking smut fungus). In the field, smutted heads usually stand more nearly erect than healthy heads because of their lighter weight. In some varieties, it is necessary to crush the kernels to determine if heads are diseased. The offensive odor indicates the presence of heavy infections either in fields or in shipped grain. Infested wheat is usually condemned before shipment. While smut balls may be removed by cleaning and recleaning seed, spores will still be carried on kernels."
,Wheat,Tan Spot," (fungus – ,): Tan spots can occur on both leaf surfaces. Initial symptoms will be tan-brown flecks and the spots will enlarge into lens-shaped lesions. The fungus grows as a saprohpyte on crop residue. Because of this it has been observed to be more severe in no-till wheat. Cultural practices such as deep burial of straw and rotation will help reduce tan spot."
,Wheat,Wheat Streak Mosaic Virus,": The vector of this virus is a microscopic eight-legged, cigar-shaped, wheat curl mite, ,. This disease is more severe in the High Plains area of Texas. Although most severe infection occurs in the fall, the characteristic yellowish streaking and mottling of leaves usually are first observed after warmer spring weather. As plants approach maturity, the leaves turn brown and die. WSMV causes red streak on corn kernels. Control for this disease is possible by clean tillage around fields, early destruction of volunteer wheat, late planting after frost"
,Wheat,Glum Blotch," (fungus – ,): Glume blotch occurs on the nodes, spikes, and glumes causing blackened areas. Stems are weakened and may bend or break just above the nodes. Seed may be shriveled, reducing yields and quality of grain. Seed treatment, rotation, deep burial of crop residue, foliar fungicides, and resistant varieties will reduce disease losses."
,Wheat,Loose Smut," (fungus – ,): Loose smut destroys the grain and all glume structures of the spike leaving only the central rachis which head early. Infected plants, produce smut spores that are wind-borne to healthy plants at flowering time. Spores germinate and germ tubes penetrate the young wheat ovaries where the fungus remain dormant until those seed germinate. Use of seed treatment fungicides and disease-free seed will prevent this disease."
,Wheat,"Rhizoctonia Root Rot,Sharp Eyespot"," and , (fungus – ,): Many , strains infect wheat roots and culms. Culm infections are sometimes observed in North Central and East Texas. These are referred to as sharp eyespot. Sharp eyespot begins as a gray colored lesion on the lower leaf sheath. Lesions may later turn straw colored. Acid, sandy and dry soils increase disease risk as do cool spring temperatures. Bare Patch of wheat is also caused by a particular strain of ,. This disease has not yet been identified in Texas."
,Wheat,Stem Rust," (fungus – , f. sp. ,): Stem rust is recognized by the elongated, ragged pustules it produces on stem, leaf, sheath, blade, chaff, beard and occasionally on young kernels. Fragments of epidermis adhere to the sides and ends of the pustules, giving a ragged appearance. The brick-red color and large elongated pustules distinguish it from leaf rust which has small round pustules and orange-red spores. Stem rust is far more devastating than leaf fust on susceptible varieties. Soft wheat varieties are generally more susceptible than hard red winter wheat varieties. Barley, rye, wild barley, and goatgrass are also susceptible."
,Wheat,Barley Yellow Dwarf Virus:," New growth of wheat plants infected in the seedling stage is chlorotic or yellowish in color. The entire plant will be severely dwarfed, tiller sparsely and produce few heads with little or no seed. Plants that become infected after the tillering stage are not dwarfed. The yellow dwarf virus can be carried from plant to plant by several species of grain aphids that overwinter on perennial grasses. No effective control measures are known other than utilizing tolerant varieties."
,Oats,Crown or Leaf Rust," (fungus – , f. sp. ,): This fungus overwinters on volunteer and wild oats. Alternate hosts of this rust are species of Rhamnus.The disease appears as tiny, round, yellowish-red pustules on either surface of the leaf blade (,). These pustules produce tiny yellow-red spores that are spread to other plants by wind currents and germinate in free moisture from dews and rains. Crown rust, like other rusts, is caused by a fungus that attacks the leaves and leaf sheath of oats and related grasses. Grazing the infected crop is a suitable means of salvaging value from the crop when damage is heavy. Some varieties have resistance (,)."
,Oats,Halo Blight," (bacterium – ,): Lesions or spots appear on leaf blades as oval to oblong water-soaked spots that are buff to light brown in color. A light-yellow zone forms a halo around the brown lesion. The bacterium enters the leaf tissue through stomata or an insect puncture. Suggested controls are seed treatment, crop residue management and rotation."
,Oats,"Leaf Blotch, Victoria Blight, Culm Rot"," (fungi – ,): Three species of fungi cause economically significant diseases of oats. With leaf blotch, oblong, linear blotches appear on the leaves. The blotches are light-yellow at first, later turning red to brown. Victoria blight is a seedling blight and sometimes seedlings are killed soon after they emerge. In other cases, plants are stunted, leaves turn red and lower leaves eventually die. Culm rot is a basal stem and root rot. Seed treatment (,) and crop rotation will help prevent this disease."
,Oats,Powdery Mildew," (fungus – ,): This fungus disease appears as patches of white, fluffy growth on the lower leaves and leaf sheaths (,). No practical control measure is available. Grazing excessive growth will allow light and air to keep the plants dry, thus reducing the severity of powdery mildew."
,Oats,Septoria Leaf Blotch," (fungi – ,sp.): Leaf blotches are gray to dark-brown and run together. Spots on the stem are black and may cause the plant to lodge. The hulls of grain may sometimes become infected and turn black. Use crop rotation and bury crop residue."
,Oats,Smuts ,"(fungi – , and ,): Loose smut (,) and covered smut (,) are two of the most common and widespread of the smut diseases of oats. The smut balls of loose smut form in the oat panicle usually destroying most or all of the seed and hulls. Wind and rain usually dislodge most of the spores soon after they appear and infected panicles are often inconspicuous in the field. The smut balls of covered smut do not ordinarily destroy the outer hulls and the spore masses remain more or less intact inside the hulls until threshing time. Seed treatment with recommended fungicide (,) will prevent both type smuts."
,Oats,Stem Rust," (fungus – , f. sp. ,): The pustules of stem rust are usually oblong and dark reddish-brown. The epidermis is ruptured and often pushed up around the edges and through the center of the pustules so that it is easily visible. The dark color of the stem rust pustule distinguishes it from the light, orange-yellow crown rust."
,Oats,Barley Yellow Dwarf Virus:," Plants are dwarfed and can be either brilliant red or yellow. Symptoms usually appear following a high population of aphids and small grain greenbug. For more information see Yellow Dwarf of Barley in the ,."
,Oats,,
,Oats,,
,Sugarcane,Banded Chlorosis," (physiological – cold injury): Symptoms are horizontal areas of light green to white tissue that extends in a narrow (2-4 inch) band across the leaf. Within a field, the banded chlorosis symptoms will be seen on leaves of different plants about the same height from the ground. It occurs as a result of cold damage to portions of unrolled leaves within the spindle. The damage is visible weeks later, when the leaves grow out. This damage does not significantly affect the plant."
,Sugarcane,Herbicide Injury,": Paraquat injury on leaves resembles fungal leafspots. Clomazone injury causes white areas on leaves. Misapplication of pendimethalin on plant cane results in poor germination and growth. Roots have a stubbiness that resembles root pruning caused by , spp. or certain nematodes."
,Sugarcane,Mosaic," (sugarcane mosaic virus): On leaves, scattered areas of lighter green coloration are seen. The chlorosis is most visible on young leaves, particularly near the base.The virus is spread via aphids and the use of infected plant cane. It also infects sorghum. The disease is controlled through the use of resistant varieties. In south Texas, it causes significant disease on CP72-1210 and NCo 310, but no yield reduction has been noticed with NCo 310. CP70-321 is resistant."
,Sugarcane,Ratoon Stunting Disease," (bacterium – , subsp. ,): The external symptoms are stunting and poor growth, which might not be noticed if most plants in a field are affected, or might be attributed to other causes. Yield losses become more pronounced with the age of ratoons. In some varieties, there is reddening of the internal tissue of the stalk, near the node. The discoloration is in the lower part of the node, where the leaf traces are. The disease is reliably diagnosed using phase-contrast microscopy or serological techniques."
,Sugarcane,,
,Sugarcane,,
,Sugarcane,Smut," (fungus – ,): The earliest symptom is the grass-like appearance of shoots, which have small and narrow leaves. Later, long, black whip-like structures appear at the stalk tip. Longer whips will curve downwards."
,Sugarcane,,
,Sugarcane,Chimera,": A chimera is a plant with distinctly different portions that arise as a result of a mutation. In sugarcane, chimeras are seen as white stripes in leaves. The stripes are straight, clearly defined and run to the tip of the leaf blade. Yield is seldom affected."
,Sugarcane,Interveinal Chlorosis, (physiological – iron deficiency): Iron deficiency is seen on young leaves. There is an interveinal chlorosis (i.e. alternating light and dark green stripes on leaves). The entire plant may be affected. Symptomatic plants may be found next to healthy plants. Plants may later recover. This is a common problem in south Texas because of the high alkalinity of soils. Foliar applications of iron sulfate are sometimes used to alleviate symptoms. A non-uniform application of iron will partially restore leaf color and excessive amounts of iron can cause necrotic spots on the leaf.
,Sugarcane,Pineapple Disease," (fungus – ,): Cane seed pieces (setts) are infected at the cut ends shortly after planting. The tissue is reddened at first, then the sett becomes hollowed and blackened. Setts do not germinate or shoots may die back shortly after emergence. Conditions that delay germination, such as delayed irrigation or cold temperatures, favor disease development. This is a minor disease in Texas and no control is warranted."
,Sugarcane,Red Rot," (fungus – ,): On leaves, there is a reddish streak on the midrib. Internal tissues of the stalk have a red coloration which is interrupted by elongated white patches. This is a minor disease in Texas. Resistant varieties are used to control the disease in other areas where it is important."
,Sugarcane,Yellow Leaf Syndrome," (virus): Symptoms occur first on older leaves. The leaf midrib yellows and the yellowing extends to the rest of the leaf. Eventually, the affected leaf dies. The incidence of this disease has been low in Texas. It has been seen in CP86-1644, CP72-1210, CP66-315 and CP65-657. As yet, there has been no measureable yield loss attributed to this disease in Texas. There are no control recommendations."
,Sugarcane,Freeze Damage:," The degree of damage caused by temperatures below freezing is a function of how low the temperature is and its duration. A light freeze can result in mosaic-like symptoms on leaves. When the stalk is cut open, browning indicates damage to the whorl, terminal bud and nodes."
,Sugarcane,Leaf Scald," (bacterium – ,): The initial characteristic symptom is a white streak (“pencil-line”) 1-2 mm wide on the leaf which follows the direction of the main veins (see illustration). The streaks may later become more enlarged and the affected leaf becomes wilted and necrotic. The white pencil line may also be visible on the leaf sheaths. Symptoms of this phase are seen after ratooning or in young shoots growing from infected plant cane. Later, these symtoms may disappear, although plants remain infected. Alternatively, plants may be infected, but grow without showing any symptoms. Mature stalks may suddenly wilt and die, sometimes without the previous appearance of other symptoms."
,Sugarcane,,
,Sugarcane,,
,Sugarcane,,
,Sugarcane,Pokkah Boeng," (fungi – , and ,): One of the symptoms is chlorosis near the base of the leaf. Leaves are crumpled, stunted and twisted, and the stem may be malformed. In advanced stages of the disease, there is a top rot; the growing point is killed and the plant dies. However, plants can also recover from symptoms. This is a minor disease in Texas and no control is warranted."
,Sugarcane,Rust," (fungus – ,): Early symptoms are tiny, elongated spots, light green to yellow. Later, the spots enlarge and turn orange to reddish-brown. Reddish spores are producedon the lower leaf surface, which come off as a fine powder when lesions are touched. Plants with heavy infection take on a reddish color. Rust is controlled through the use of resistant varieties. In south Texas, it can cause significant disease on CP70-321 and CP72-1210."

,Sunflower,Charcoal Rot," (fungus – ,): The symptoms are premature ripening of stalks with a poorly filled head. At the base, the inside of the stem has a shredded appearance, and the fibers are covered with numerous, tiny black resting bodies of the fungus that resemble pepper flecks. Varieties may differ in resistance to this disease."
,Sunflower,Rhizopus Head Rot," (fungi – , spp.): The head turns brown and becomes soft. A gray mycelial growth will later develop. Wet weather following flowering favors disease development, particularly if the heads are damaged by hail, birds, or insects. In Texas, head rot has been associated with larvae of the sunflower moth, ,. There is no control, although varieties with upright heads are more frequently infected than varieties with bending heads."
,Sunflower,Southern Blight," (fungus – ,): Plants wilt, then die. A bright, white mycelial growth can be seen at the base of the stalk. The diagnosis is confirmed by presence of round, tan resting bodies of the fungus, which resemble mustard seeds. This fungus is soilborne."
,Sunflower,Downy Mildew," (fungus – ,): The symptoms are pale green or yellowish areas spreading out from the midrib of leaves. With moist weather, there is the presence of a downy growth on the underside of the leaves. As the plants mature, there may be some wrinkling and distortion of the leaves and plants are stunted. Angular leafspots can also be produced. The disease is seed and soilborne. Resistant varieties are available."
,Sunflower,Rust,"(fungus – ,): Small, dark brown, powdery pustules on the underside of leaves are surrounded by chlorotic areas. Many of these pustules will cause the leaf to take on a brown appearance. These heavily-infected leaves will die. A severe infection will reduce seed quality and yield. The use of resistant cultivars is the best control measure. In addition, residue from previous crops should be buried and volunteers should be controlled."
,Sunflower,Mosaic," (virus): Mottled areas are visible on newer leaves. This virus symptom was seen in the Lower Rio Grande Valley. The virus has been tentatively identified as a member of the , group. It occurs infrequently."
,Sunflower,Powdery Mildew," (fungus – ,): The symptoms are an extensive growth of white, powdery fungal mycelium on the upper leaf surface. The disease usually occurs too late in the season to affect yield."
,Sunflower,Sclerotinia Wilt," (fungus – ,): Plants wilt, then die. A bright, white mycelial growth can be seen at the base of the plant, along with considerable shredding of the stalk. Black, irregularly-shaped resting bodies of the fungus are found within the stem. A long crop rotation with non-susceptible crops, such as corn, sorghum or wheat, is the recommended control."

,Vetch,Anthracnose," (fungus – ,spp.): Brown to dark black spots appear on leaves and stems. Defoliation along with stem girdling causes plant death in rank growth. The problem is more severe in wet years. The organism is seed borne and is carried over in crop residue. Avoid planting on poorly drained soil and rotate with unrelated crops."
,Vetch,Root Knot Nematodes," (nematode – , spp.): Most vetch varieties are highly susceptible to root knot nematodes. If planted on infested fields some stunting and plant death may result. An increase in the nematode population may also cause severe damage on susceptible crops grown later. Cahaba White is a variety resistant to , but not other root knot species."
,Vetch,Powdery Mildew," (fungus – ,): Powdery mildew is an occasional problem that occurs during cool, dry periods. Some defoliation may occur in heavy vine growth. No fungicides are cleared for use."
,Lespedeza,,
,Lespedeza,Dodder," (parasitic plant – ,spp.): This small, light yellow parasitic plant wraps itself around the stems of lespedeza plants. It produces suckers or haustoria that penetrate the host tissue and serve to extract nutrients from it. When it occurs in a localized area, a burning device such as a prickly pear burner can be used to eradicate the plant."
,Lespedeza,Leafspot," (fungi – , spp. and other fungi): Although leafspots occur, they seldom become a limiting production factor. Stands heavily spotted should be cut or grazed to remove inoculum potential."

,Zinnia,Blight," (fungus – ,):  Small, reddish-brown spots with grayish centers are the first symptoms  of this widespread and highly troublesome disease. Dark brown cankers  also occur on the stems. Flowers are spotted and at times completely  blighted. Because the causal fungus may be carried with the seed, treat  the seed before planting with hot water at 125 degrees F for 30 minutes.  Then cool and dry. Older seeds are more easily injured by this  treatment. Use recommended protectant fungicide."

Create a Buffer Zone:," Oak wilt fungus transmission through root spread between adjoining trees accounts for most of the tree loss in oak wilt centers. Root spread can be stopped by creating a buffer zone between the oak wilt center and healthy trees. A trench (,) should be established at least 100 feet from the last symptomatic tree. Using a rock saw, commercial ditching machine or a backhoe, the trench is dug at least 48 inches deep. The trench is immediately filled. It severs the roots between neighboring trees and prevents fungus spread between trees through root connections."
,Eight Step Program to Oak Wilt Management,Step 3. Sanitation:," Remove dead (,) or diseased trees in the oak wilt center if they are not going to be treated with a systemic fungicide. Trees should be burned in place when possible, especially if Spanish, Shumard, water and black jack oaks are present in the disease center. These species of oak trees form fungal mats (,) that produce spores which can spread infection. Spores become attached to the bodies of sap feeding insects attracted by the sweet smelling fungal mats, and spread to healthy trees (,), creating new disease centers."
,Eight Step Program to Oak Wilt Management,Step 4. Pruning:," Plant sap on the surface of a cut or wound attracts sap feeding beetles. During insect feeding, the fungus spores transported by the beetles are dislodged on to the tree’s surface, germinate and infect the new host. Studies have shown that the beetles are most active in the early spring. This is also the time when the fungal mats are actively producing spores. Avoid pruning between February 15 and June 15, the period for maximum insect and fungal mat activity. This window of spread will vary depending upon location in the state. In the South Texas area, the timing will be slightly earlier, but in the Panhandle the timing would be later. When possible prune trees between December 1 and February 1, or between July 1 and October 1."
,Eight Step Program to Oak Wilt Management,Step 5. Protecting Pruning Cuts or Wounds:," Trees near oak wilt centers that are wounded or that must be pruned during the most active insect and fungal mat season, should be protected with a wound paint. These materials provide a protective layer between the fresh cut and the sap feeding beetles. Apply the paint in a thin layer immediately after wounding. Most products have either an asphalt or latex base. All cuts greater than 1/2 inch should be painted. Wound paints should always be used when pruning trees in the immediate vicintiy of an oak wilt center. Trees within 3 miles of an oak wilt center should be painted during critical periods of insect and fungus activity. Paint is not required for trees in areas free of the oak wilt fungus."
,Eight Step Program to Oak Wilt Management,Step 6. Firewood:," Firewood cut from tree species that form oak wilt mats can spread the fungus. If questions arise about where the trees were cut for wood or the species of tree cut, it is best to cover the wood pile with clear plastic. Make sure the edges are tucked into the soil to prevent insect spread (,). For trees that die in the spring or early summer, firewood can be safely cut by the fall. As the tree dries, it can no longer support growth of the oak wilt fungus. Also, the oak wilt fungus is not a good competitor with other fungi or bacteriathat invade dead wood. Smoke from burning diseased logs does not represent a problem. Heat from the fire kills all spores or beetles that might be present. It is suggested that firewood be burned during the season it was purchased and not stored for the following season."
,Eight Step Program to Oak Wilt Management,Step 7. Tree Injection With Systemic Fungicide:," Trees within the buffer zone can be treated with a systemic fungicide (,). Alamo is the product labeled for use in the control of oak wilt. It is applied by injecting the fungicide into the root flares. Alamo is most effective when applied as a preventive treatment. However, it can be applied after the tree develops symptoms. Trees that are symptomatic have less chance of complete recovery than those that are free of symptoms. Trees with more than 30% canopy loss should not be treated."
,Eight Step Program to Oak Wilt Management,Step 8. Replanting:," In some areas, oak wilt has already caused extensive losses to landscape trees. Property owners can successfully replant live oaks, Spanish, Shumard and water oaks if precautions are taken to avoid wounds. It is always best to use a mixed planting of trees to add variety to the landscape and reduce the chance of a recurrence of oak wilt or similar disease problems. Post oak is a species of white oak that is resistant to the fungus but cannot be successfully replanted due to slow root development. Overcup oak, bur oak, white oak and other members of the white oak family are resistant to the fungus and can be planted in oak wilt centers. Chinkapin and swamp chestnut oak are chestnut oaks that can be grown in some areas of Texas and have some resistance to the oak wilt fungus. Cedar elm and Chinese elm are suggested for planting in many of the areas where oak wilt is a problem. Chinese pistache, ball cypress and flowering pears are other trees that can be planted in most areas where oak wilt is a problem. Before planting a tree, check with your local County Extension Agent, County Horticulturists, Arborists, Forester or Nurserymen on how that tree will do in your location."

,Fairy Rings,Control and Management,: Mushrooms may or may not develop after a period of heavy rainfall or irrigation. Vertical mowing and topdressing to reduce thatch and removal of tree stumps and roots reduce the organic matter on which the fungus feeds. Fertilization may mask dark green fairy rings by stimulating growth in the rest of the turf. Aeration and drenching the soil with a wetting agent will minimize development of the zone of brown or dead grass in the area of dense mycelial growth.

,Boxelder,,
,Boxelder,Verticillium wilt," (fungus – ,):  This is one of the most common fungal diseases of plants attacking over  300 species. Boxelder is a member of the maple family and this disease  is the most important killer of trees in that family. Symptoms include  sudden wilting, usually of individual branches, followed by yellowing  and finally browning of the foliage. Extensive internal streaking of the  outer sapwood. Infected trees should be removed and burned. If a tree  is to be saved for as long as possible, prune off all dead and dying  branches. Cutting tools should be sterilized with 10 percent bleach  between cuts. Inspect the tree periodically for dying branches."
,Boxelder,Anthracnose," (fungus – , sp.): Spots are indefinite, light brown, and may enlarge and run  together causing the death of entire leaves. Leaves partially killed  appear as if scorched. The disease is more common during prolonged rain  periods when it may cause severe defoliation of trees. Several  applications of fungicides may be required to control the disease during  periods of high humidity."
,Boxelder,Leaf Spo,"t (fungi – ,, ,, ,): These fungi attack many species of the maple family (,) including boxelder. The following fungi attack only boxelder: ,.  Many leaf spots, one-fourth inch or more in diameter, some irregular,  some with indefinite margins, occur on boxelder. Spots have brown  margins and light colored centers. Some of the spots may develop black  bodies, which are the fruiting structures of the fungi. Diseased, fallen  leaves should be raked up and burned. Spraying the tree several times  at two week intervals may be needed to keep the disease in check."
,Boxelder,Powdery Mildew," (fungus – ,): A white to grayish mold develops on the surface of the leaves. The disease is seldom serious on boxelder."
,Boxelder,Heart Rot," (fungus – , sp.): The fungus enters the  trunk generally through wounds or branch stubs resulting from pruning or  mechanical damage. The rot is generally found on dead timber, but the  fungus can get established on living trees and destroy the heartwood.  New conks, or fruiting bodies of the fungus may appear annually, but  they are perennial structures, putting on another spore-producing layer  each year. Best control is achieved through prevention. Avoid mechanical  injuries to trees, such as would result from hitting the trunk with  lawn mowers and other garden instruments. Paint wound with a pruning  compound; remove and destroy conks. Make pruning cuts flush with the  main trunk and do not leave branch stubs."
,Boxelder,Crown Gal,"l (bacterium – ,): (See section on ,)"
,Boxelder,Cotton Root Rot," (fungus – ,): Boxelder is moderately susceptible to the cotton root rot fungus. (See section on ,)"
,Boxelder,Herbicide damage,": Boxelder is highly susceptible to 2-4-D, causing distortion, dwarfing, and blighting of foliage."
,Tulip,,
,Tulip,"Bulb, Crown and Root Rot"," (fungi – , spp., ,, , spp., , spp., ,, ,, , spp.): Tulips may not come up or leaves may be yellow or reddish,  stunted, and die because the bulb is rotted. Root may be slimy, soft,  dry, hard or powdery in texture. Color may be dark or light gray, black  or brown with moldy growth on bulb or scales. Remove and destroy  infected plants. Avoid bruising in handling bulbs. Plant clean  disease-free bulbs. Water and fertilize properly."
,Tulip,Botrytis Blight," (fungus – ,):  Leaves and petals are affected with a brown decay, which often destroys  large areas. Buds are sometimes blighted, or the flower stalks may tip  over from a spot on the side where the fungus has attacked. A  brownish-gray, powdery mold is produced on the surface of affected  parts. All affected parts should be gathered and burned as soon as  possible. Badly affected bulbs should be destroyed. Tulips should not be  planted the next year in soil where this disease has been abundant.  Plant grown in the greenhouse should be kept well ventilated."
,Tulip,Virus Diseases," (Tulip breaking, Mosaic): Flowers may show changes in color with  breaking, streaking, greening or darkening. Leaves and flower stems are  mottled or streaked with light green or yellow areas. Plants are stunted  and have poor vigor. Viruses are spread by cutting flowers and by  several species of aphids. Destroy diseased plants when found. Control  insects and weeds."
,Violet and Pansy,,
,Violet and Pansy,Leaf Spots," (fungi – ,, ,):  Chlorotic spots on lower leaves, centers later turn brown. Usually on  lower leaves first. Regular sprays with a foliar fungicide will control  the disease."
,Violet and Pansy,Anthracnose," (fungus – ,):  Browning or blotching of leaves. Spots may be small at first, but later  enlarge. Spots may coalesce. Sunken, elongated dark brown to black  lesions may appear on stems. In severe cases entire plant may be killed.  Regular foliar fungicide applications will control this disease."
,Violet and Pansy,Scab," (fungus – ,):  Small, green water-soaked dots. These later enlarge to form circular  scabby spots. They may be gray-to-white surrounded by a dark-green  border. Lesions may extend along a leaf veins and cause the veins to  become distorted. Wilting of the leaves may result from petiole  infections. A regular spray schedule with a foliar fungicide"
,Violet and Pansy,Damping-Off," (fungi – , spp., , spp., and , spp.): Plants wilt and die suddenly. A dark sunken area may be seen on  the stem at or near the soil line. Use sterilized potting soil. Remove  and destroy diseased plants."
,Violet and Pansy,Cotton Root Rot,": (See the section on ,)"
,Violet and Pansy,Southern Blight,": (See the section on ,)"
,Violet and Pansy,Root Knot and Other Nematodes,": (See the section on , and ,)"
,Sweet Pea,,
,Sweet Pea,Anthracnose," (fungus – ,):  Leaves, flowers and shoots are at first marked with whitish spots.  These spots spread extensively so that the parts attacked finally wilt  and die. Seed pods shrivel and lose their color. Heavy infection results  in much loss of leaves. The wilting works downward from the tips of the  younger shoots, which become whitish and sometimes break. With a hand  lens, many small salmon-colored pustules bearing great quantities of  spores can be seen on the diseased parts. Gather and burn all infected  plant parts after the flower season. Choose only seed pods which are  plump and sound in appearance for planting. Seed for planting should be  selected from disease-free pods. An occasional application of fungicide  during the growing season helps minimize disease."
,Sweet Pea,Powdery Mildew," (fungus – ,):  Whitish, powdery growth on upper side of leaf surfaces. Leaves shrivel  and drop off. Dust with sulfur or spray with recommended fungicide."
,Sweet Pea,Downy Mildew," (fungus – ,):  Under moist conditions, the leaves become covered with a grayish moldy  growth. Thick-walled, brown resting spores develop within the moldy  tissue. Since this is not a serious disease of this host in America,  control measures have not been developed."
,Sweet Pea,Leaf Spots," (fungi – ,, ,, ,, M,): Infection is not normally severe and spotted leaves can be picked off and destroyed as soon as they appear."
,Sweet Pea,Stem and Root Rot,": (See the section on ,)"
,Sweet Pea,White Mold," (fungus – , f. spp. ,):  This mold, which may cover both sides of the leaves, may be mistaken  for powdery mildew. Faint, dull-colored, irregular, elongated spots,  which may be somewhat sunken, appear. The spots on the leaf margins, at  first water-soaked in appearance, later have a reddish-brown  discoloration. Tufts of spore-bearing hyphae develop from the stomatal  openings between the epidermal cells. Spray with recommended fungicide  as soon as white mold is noticed."
,Sweet Pea,Fasciation," (bacterium – ,):  Dense witches’ broom, distortions and fasciations develop at the base  of the stem or from below the soil line. Since the pathogen is  seed-borne, plant clean seed."
,Snapdragon,,
,Snapdragon,Anthracnose," (fungus – ,):  Large, light colored spots occur on leaves and stems. Spots frequently  have black or brownish dots near centers. Entire leaves may be killed  and often the whole plant dies from stem girdling. Spore bearing  pustules appear as minute black pimples in the spots. Under a  microscope, dark brown, hair-like outgrowths are visible on these  pustules. Pull and burn affected plants as soon as disease appears.  Spray with recommended fungicides to prevent spread. Water by irrigating  surface of soil rather than wetting the foliage. Take cuttings only  from healthy plants."
,Snapdragon,Rust," (fungus – ,):  Brown, powdery pustules appear on lower surface of leaves. Plants may  be stunted and even killed. Propagate from healthy plants or grow from  seed. Control insects that carry the fungus spores from one plant to  another. Plants should be spaced so that they have plenty of air. Avoid  wetting the foliage when watering. Keep greenhouse temperature above 70,F for several days and not below 60,F  at night. Where foliage is wet when watering, spray at weekly intervals  with recommended fungicide. Good coverage is necessary for best  results. Some resistant varieties are available."
,Snapdragon,Blight," (fungus – ,):  Cream colored or light brown circular spots appear on the leaves,  sometimes surrounded by circles of other colors. The small black  fruiting bodies of the fungus develop on the upper surface of the leaves  at the center of the spots. Ash-gray spots covered with the black  pycnidia develop on stems. These spots enlarge rapidly and turn dark  brown. If the spots entirely encircle the stem, the plants wilt and  frequently die. All parts of the plants in diseased beds should be  removed and burned at the end of the season. Spray with recommended  fungicides. Keep leaves dry and space more widely."
,Snapdragon,Wilt," (fungus – ,):  Infected plants wilt slowly. At first, only certain branches show  wilting. Plant in disease-free soil or sterilize soil with steam. When  only a few plants appear infected, remove these together with  surrounding soil. Water as little as possible to obtain good growth.  Cotton burs used for mulch in West Texas may carry the fungus and should  be well composted."
,Snapdragon,Gray Mold," (fungus – ,): This fungus  causes a wilting of the flower stalks. A development of light brown  areas on the stems at the base of the flower clusters. Under moist  conditions, the spores of the fungus may develop in light brown or gray  masses. Avoid excess humidity. Cut off and burn infected flower-stalks  as soon as they are detected. Keep greenhouse and garden plantings free  from debris because the fungus can live as a decay fungus under such  conditions and its spores may be blown to living plants. Spray with  recommended fungicides after the plants have been cut back to force a  second crop."
,Snapdragon,Powdery Mildew," (fungus – , spp.):  Largely confined to greenhouse-grown snapdragons, this mildew forms a  white, powdery coating on both leaf surfaces and young stems. Spray with  recommended fungicide."
,Snapdragon,Leaf Spot," (fungus – ,):  Previously reported only from Guatemala, this leaf spot was found in  Florida in 1958. Spots are circular, 0.5 to 5 mm in diameter, dingy gray  to white. No control measures have been developed but fungicides that  control , spp. on other crops might be effective."

,Snapdragon,Cotton Root Rot,": (See section on ,)"
,Phlox, spp.,
,Phlox,Leaf Spots," (fungi – , spp., , spp., , spp., , spp., , spp., , spp., and , spp.): , is among the most common and most destructive. It attacks primarily the  lower leaves, producing dark brown, circular spots up to one-fourth  inch in diameter, the centers of which are light gray, almost white.  Infected leaves dry up and die prematurely. For control, spray  periodically with recommended fungicides and burn infected leaves."
,Phlox,Powdery Mildew," (fungi – , and ,):  White or grayish moldy growth on upper side of older leaves. Leaves  gradually die, beginning on the lower part of the plant. For control,  spray with recommended fungicides as soon as the mildew appears."
,Phlox,Rust," (fungi – , and , f. spp. ,):  Neither rust is important enough to warrant control. Both rusts appear  on leaves as raised blisters or pustules covered with a brown coating  that ruptures releasing the brown spores."
,Phlox,Cotton Root Rot,": (See the section on ,)"
,Phlox,Crown Rot," (fungi – , spp., , spp. and , spp.): These fungi are destructive on seedlings. They cause a rotting  of the plant at the soil line. Sterilizing potting soil is the best  control."
,Phlox,Wilts," (fungus – ,): (See the section on ,)"
,Phlox,Crown Gall,": (See the section on ,)"
,Phlox,Aster Yellows," (mycoplasma): Flower petals often show white  steaks and vein banding. Clusters of flowers or individual petals may  turn into green, leafy structures."
,Phlox,Stem Blight," (fungus – , spp.): Base of stem and roots may rot. They may be covered with a  cottony mold. Avoid overwatering, overcrowding and planting in heavy,  poorly drained soil."
,Phlox,Physiological Diseases,: No organisms  are associated with this condition. The disease is characterized by  death of the lower leaves from the base progressively upward until the  entire shoot is killed. The disease is most severe on old clumps and is  entirely absent on seedlings or newly rooted cuttings. The trouble seems  to be caused by excessive transpiration.
,Phlox,Root Knot Nematodes,": (See the section on ,)"
,Petunia,,
,Petunia,Damping-Off and Stem Rot," (fungi – ,, , spp., , spp.): A damping-off or decay of plant at or below the soil line. A  dark brown-to-black lesion on stems and crown. Use sterilized potting  mix. A fungicide drench will help prevent spread."
,Petunia,Mosaic, (virus – TMV): Crinkled leaves with yellow and green areas. Plant may be stunted. Destroy diseased plants. No control.
,Petunia,Crown Rot," (fungus – ,):  A black discoloration and dry rot of the crown and lateral branches  occurs near the soil line. This is followed by wilting and death of the  affected plants."
,Petunia,Aster Yellows," (mycoplasma): Plants are  yellowish, bushy, and dwarfed with many rosette-like, secondary shoots.  Flowers often malformed and greenish. Leaves may curl, turn yellow or  purple."
,Petunia, Root Knot Nematode," (nematode – , spp.): (See the section on ,)"
,Periwinkle,,
,Periwinkle,Pythium Root and Stem Rot," (fungus – , spp.): Lesions produced on stems and roots with rapid progression of  symptoms. Infected plants die soon after infection. Avoid overwatering  and use suggested fungicide."
,Periwinkle,Other Root and Stem Rots," (fungi – , and others): Lesions occur on roots and lower stem. Periwinkle is more  resistant to this problem than most annuals, but disease can occur when  fungi are present in high populations. Rotate plantings and use  recommended soil fungicides if needed."
,Periwinkle,Aster Yellows, (mycoplasma): Infected plants are chlorotic and stunted. Control  leafhoppers that transmit the disease-causing entity and rogue infected  plants.
,Periwinkle,Canker and Dieback," (fungus – , sp.):  Shoot tips will turn dark brown-to-black and die back to the soil.  Favored by rainy weather. Preventative spray of copper fungicide  starting in spring on new growth will control the fungus."
,Periwinkle,Phytophthora Aerial Blight," (fungus – ,):  Infection is generally characterized by leaf blight and upper stem  deterioration. Infection is distinctly an aerial problem, not involving  lower stem and root tissue. In most cases, leaves are shriveled and  dull-gray in color. An aerial sunken stem canker can also develop.  Symptoms develop rapidly in outdoor planted beds, especially during  conditions of prolonged, rainy weather. Bark mulches or other mulch  materials might help minimize splash dispersal of infested soil  particles. No fungicides are currently cleared for use in control."
,Peony, spp.,
,Peony,Botrytis Blight," (fungus – ,):  Most common disease of peony. Young shoots in all stages of growth,  including the buds may suddenly wilt and fall over. Upon examination, a  brown or blackish rot is seen at the base of the stem. This  discoloration may extend down through the roots. Small buds attacked by  the fungus turn black and dry up. Larger buds turn brown and may be  covered with a brown spore mass. Large irregular dark brown lesions may  occur on the leaves. Cool, rainy weather favors disease development.  Splashing rain and insects spread the disease. Regular applications of a  foliar fungicide, a drench, and destruction of infected plant material  are recommended control measures."
,Peony,Root and Stem Rot," (fungus – ,):  Infected parts are dark brown to black and leathery. Cankers appear  along the stems and may cause them to fall over. May also cause a watery  crown rot often destroying the entire plant. Roguing and destroying all  infected plants is the only means of control."
,Peony,Wilt," (fungus – ,):  Plants gradually wilt and die during the blooming season. Brown  discoloration of the water conducting tissues may be seen in cross  sections of the roots or stems. Obtain disease-free plants, remove and  destroy infected plants. Potting soil should be sterilized."
,Peony,Mosaic, (virus): Circular areas consisting of concentric bands of alternating  dark and light green on leaves. Small necrotic spots may also form.  Plants are not dwarfed. No control other than destroying infected  plants.
,Peony,Cotton Root Rot,": (See the section on ,)"
,Peony,Southern Blight,": (See the section on ,)"
,Peony,Root Knot and Other Nematodes,": (See the section on , and ,)"
,Peony,Leaf Spot," (fungus – , spp.): Leaves may have brown purplish or reddish irregular shaped spots. Leaves may yellow, wither and fall early."
,Peony,Crown Gall," (bacterium – ,): (See the section on ,)"
,Peony,Powdery Mildew," (fungus – ,):  Powdery, white mold on leaves. Leaves may be deformed, turn yellow and  drop early. Collect and destroy fallen leaves and provide adequate  spacing of plants."
,Peony,Ring Spot," (virus): Plants may be  severely stunted with lemon-yellow to orange-amber spots, blotches or  zoned rings. Young leaves may be distorted and plants may not flower. Do  not propagate from infected plants."
,Iris, spp.,
,Iris,Leaf Spot," (fungus – ,):  Irregular, eye-spots which vary in size and run together. They have a  grayish center with dark brown borders. The disease usually is more or  less confined to the upper surface of the leaf. Carefully remove and  burn old iris leaves in the fall or early spring."
,Iris,Leaf Spot," (fungus – ,):  Common leafspot of iris in Central Texas. Disease shows up on both  upper and lower leaf surfaces as 1/8 to 3/8 inch diameter, irregular  spots with dark brown centers and outer edges. Remainder of spot is  light tan. Good sanitation is best control. Removal and burning of old  leaves each fall is desirable."
,Iris,Basal Rot," (fungus – ,):  This soil fungus enters the roots of bulbous iris and then penetrates  the base of the plant and the scales of the bulb. Bulbs should be dried  rapidly to avoid possible injury. Cull and discard damaged bulbs."
,Iris,Soft Rot," (bacterium – ,):  A foul-smelling soft rot of the rhizome. At first, the leaves begin to  turn brown and dieback progresses until the entire plant is dead. The  disease is favored by wet, heavy soils or shady locations that tend to  keep the ground continuously moist. Plant iris in a well-drained soil  and avoid crowded conditions in the bed. In the fall, destroy all dead  leaves and plant residue in the iris bed. In season when soft rot is  severe, take up the rhizomes in August or September. Cut out the destroy  all rotted portions of the rhizomes. Plant in a new location or  sterilize the soil. Avoid excessive watering during the growing season.  The disease is easily spread to new iris plantings during lifting and  dividing operations by spades and other tools. Control iris insects such  as the iris borer."
,Iris,Rust," (fungus – , spp.):  Rusty-red, powdery pustules break out on both sides of the leaves,  causing considerable damage to many varieties. Destroy all fallen leaves  before growth starts in the spring."
,Iris,Mosaic, (virus): Yellow  striping or mottling of the leaves and flowers. The potato and peach  aphids transmit this virus. Discard all infected plants. Control aphids  that transmit the virus.
,Iris,Other Disease:," Iris are attacked by several species of nematodes and , rolpii. (See discussion in other sections for more information.)"

,Root Knot Nematodes,,
,Hydrangea, spp.,
,Hydrangea,Leaf Spots," (fungi – , spp., , and others): Circular-to-irregular shaped spots are produced on leaves. Use foliar protectant fungicides as needed."
,Hydrangea,Powdery Mildew," (fungus – ,):  A white, powdery substance appears on leaf surfaces. Yellow spots that  later turn brown may appear on the upper surface. If allowed to develop,  it may get into newly developing buds and cause stunting. Use a foliar  fungicide that has the ability to control powdery mildew."
,Hydrangea,Botrytis Blight," (fungus – ,):  Botrytis is probably the most serious fungus attacking this plant  because it causes severe problems in the flower buds. Infected flower  parts may drop on leaves and cause infection of those structures. Cool,  damp conditions with an abundance of fungal spores encourage the  condition. This problem is especially severe at times in commercial  greenhouses. Dispose of any weak or decaying plant tissue and use  appropriate protectant fungicides if necessary."
,Hydrangea,Ring Spot, (virus – Hydrangea ring-spot virus): Pale colored rings may appear on  leaves and some varieties may have distorted leaves. Dispose of diseased  plants. Commercial plant producers should use tolerant varieties.
,Hydrangea,Nematodes," (nematodes – , spp., , spp., and , spp.): Nematode damage occurs when this plant is set in infested beds.  Plants grown in pots would not be affected if nematode-free propagating  stock and sterilized soil is used."
,Hollyhock,,
,Hollyhock,Anthracnose," (fungus – ,):  This is the most destructive disease on Hollyhock. Fungus attacks  leaves, stems and petioles. Typical fungal leaf spots, black blotches on  petioles and stems. May also infect lower portions of stems and roots.  High temperature and humidity favor development of the disease. Remove  and destroy infected plant material and use a regular fungicide  application."
,Hollyhock,Rust," (fungus – ,): This  is the most prevalent disease on Hollyhock in Texas and all portions of  the plant are subject to infection. Small brown spots appear on  underside of leaves. On upper leaf surface spots are yellow-to-orange  and larger. Spots may coalesce and kill large portions on the leaf.  Removal and destruction of infected plant material and regular  applications of a fungicide will control rust."
,Hollyhock,Leaf Spots," (fungi – , spp., , spp., , spp.): Small angular grayish spots are scattered irregularly over  leaves. Dead tissue may fall out leaving a shot hole appearance. Removal  and destruction of infected plant material and regular applications of a  foliar fungicide."
,Hollyhock,Cotton Root Rot,": (See section on ,)."
,Hollyhock,Other Diseases:," See the appropriate sections on , and ,."
,Gladiolus,,
,Gladiolus,Fusarium Rot," (fungus – , f. sp. ,):  Corms decay with a brownish-to-black dry rot of the tissue. The foliage  of affected plants first turn yellow and then brown. Roots are killed.  When diseased corms are planted, many may rot before producing plants  while other produce weak plants that soon die. Before planting, inspect  and remove all corms that have discolored areas or lesions. Healthy  appearing corm should be chemically treated before planting."
,Gladiolus,Scab," (bacterium – ,):  Small definitely outlined lesions appear on diseased corms. The lesions  are circular, water-soaked and pinpoint to one-fourth inch diameter. A  gummy ooze is produced from these spots that is yellow-to-dark brown in  color. The lesions are rather shallow. Badly affected plants may die  while those less affected have an unthrifty appearance. Mites that occur  in the soil seem to serve as a vector and should be controlled with  soil treatment if this disease is a problem. Do not plant infected  corms. Rotate areas where gladiolus are planted."
,Gladiolus,Botrytis Blight," (fungus – , spp.): Leaves, stems, flowers and corms are infected. Leaf spots are  variable in size and shape. Infected flowers decline rapidly and have  grayish fungal growth on the surface. The tissues become moist and  slimy. Under severe conditions the entire top may be killed. Infected  corms have irregularly shaped sclerotia attached to them. Affected corms  should be discarded. Use suggested fungicides for controlling the  disease on above-ground plant parts."
,Gladiolus,Other Leaf Spots," (Bacterium-Bacterial Leaf Blight – , spp.): Water-soaked spots appear on leaves with a bacterial ooze occurring during wet periods. (Fungus – , Leaf Spot – , gladioli) Small rot. (Fungus – , Leaf Blight – , spp.) Light green-to-yellow lesions form on leaves. Spots turn red."
,Gladiolus,Virus or Virus-Like Diseases," (Virus-Mild Mosaic): Caused by the bean yellow mosaic virus. Produces  angular light and dark green mottling of leaves and flower stems. Virus  is transmitted by aphids. (Mycoplasma – Aster Yellow) Flower parts  remain green and fail to form normal color pigment. Plants turn yellow  and degenerate prematurely. (Virus – White Break Mosaic) Caused by the  cucumber mottle virus. Causes flowers to be blotched, open slowly and  fade early. Plants are stunted. (Virus – Ring Spot) Caused by the  tobacco ring-spot virus. Ring spots appear on leaves but flower parts  are not affected."
,Geranium,,
,Geranium,Cutting Rot," (fungi  and bacteria): Geraniums are grown from seed but often propagation is  done with cuttings. Cuttings are susceptible to invasion by numerous  soil-borne organisms, and, thus, treatment of cuttings with a fungicide  is often necessary. Allowing the cuttings to “heal” before planting will  help reduce stem rot. Wound healing takes place if cuttings are laid on  damp sand in heavy shade for approximately three hours. Bacteria (, sp.) and fungi (, sp., , sp., , sp., and , sp.) cause stem rot. They may infect stems singularly or in combination."
,Geranium,Black Leg," (fungus – , spp.): Generally a disease of cuttings and young plants. Stems and  petioles blacken and a soft rot develops. Rotting starts at the base of  the stem and may extend well above the soil line. Plants wilt and die.  Symptoms progress rapidly. Control may require sterilizing potting mix  and tools. Treat cuttings with a fungicide. A soil drench may retard  spread of the disease in propagating benches."
,Geranium,Botrytis Blight," (fungus – ,):  Affects blossoms, leaves and stems. On flowers, petals darken at edges  and wilt prematurely. Affects central florets first. If humidity is  high, spore masses may be found on flowers and leaves. Spots on leaves  are irregular, brown and have a water-soaked appearance. Botrytis will  cause a soft rot of cuttings. Proper sanitation in greenhouses by  removing and destroying infected plant material will prevent spread. Use  of a foliar fungicide when conditions are favorable for infection will  help to prevent the disease. Improving ventilation and air circulation  among the plants will also reduce infection."
,Geranium,Rust," (fungus – ,):  Rust occasionally is found on cultivated geraniums. Distinct, reddish  pustules form on the underleaf surfaces in a circular pattern. The upper  surface is yellow in areas where pustules form. Control rust by  removing infected leaves and spraying with a fungicide."
,Geranium,Bacterial Leaf Spot and Stem Rot," (bacterium – , pv. ,):  Leaf spots begin as small, water-soaked spots on the underside of  leaves. Spots become well defined and slightly sunken in a few days.  Necrosis and wilting of the entire leaf follows, but the spots do not  coalesce. Another symptom is rapid wilting of the leaf margin resulting  in an angular pattern bound by the veins. Stem rot begins with one or  two branches showing wilt. Eventually, the entire stem turns black with  only a few leaves remaining at the terminals. Within the stem, the  vascular fibers remain intact but the support tissue around the fibers  is destroyed. Controls consist of using disease-free plants for  cuttings, controlling the humidity in greenhouses, avoid wetting leaves  when watering."
,Geranium,Viruses,": Several viruses are known to affect  geraniums. They cause mosaic patterns, mottling, crinkled or cupped  leaves. Rogue out diseased plants as soon as they are noticed and use  disease-free plants for propagation."
,Geranium,Oedema," (physiological): At first, oedema appears as water-soaked spots on  bottoms of leaves which later become corky and brown. The leaves may  turn yellow and fall off. Oedema is caused by moist, warm soil and  moist, cool air or cloudy conditions that result in more water being  absorbed by roots than is being transpired by the leaves. As a result,  cells swell and burst. Avoid over-watering and increase ventilation."
,Dahlia,,
,Dahlia,Powdery Mildew," (fungus – ,): Whitish-to-grayish growth covering upper surface of leaves. Avoid shaded locations and crowding of plants."
,Dahlia,Ring Spot and Mosaic," (viruses): Leaves are light green with mottled areas. Veins of leaf may  appear light. Plants may be dwarfed and bushy. Leaves may have light  green ring spots. Remove and destroy all infected plants as soon as  detected. Tubers from virus-infected plants should never be used for  planting purposes. Control aphids, leafhoppers and thrips."
,Dahlia,Other Disease,": Dahlias are susceptible to ,, Bacterial Wilt, Root Rots, ,, ,, and ,.  In every case, diseased plants should not be used for propagation of  new plants. (See the appropriate section for more information on these  diseases.)"
,Dahlia,Tuber Rot," (fungus – ,): The most popular method of propagation is root division. To avoid root decay, dust fresh cuts with sulfur."
,Dahlia,Flower Blight," (fungus – , spp.): In moist weather the buds may be attacked by a soft rot and all  infected parts may become covered with the grayish, powdery mold."
,Dahlia,Dahlia Mosaic," (virus): Infected plants are stunted, yellow and pale green bands will  develop along the veins of affected leaves. The leaves may be smaller  than normal, wrinkled or blistered."
,Dahlia,Dahlia Ringspot," (virus): Yellow circles, dime-sized, will develop on the leaves. As time  passes these may merge into larger yellow to pale green areas and the  centers of the rings may turn brown. This disease is carried in roots  and cuttings from diseased plants. Dahlia mosaic and ringspot can also  be transmitted by insects."
,Chrysanthemum,,
,Chrysanthemum,Fusarium Wilt," (fungus – , spp.): When this disease occurs lower leaves turn yellow and wilt,  followed by overall plant wilting and death of entire plant. Lower  portion of stem near soil line turns dark brown-to-black with brown  discoloration in vascular tissues. Planting disease-free cuttings,  sterilization of potting soil and benches offer best means of control."
,Chrysanthemum,Verticillium Wilt," (fungus – , spp.): This disease is mainly in western areas of Texas. General  wilting. Leaves become paler green, turn brown and die. Leaves remain  attached to stem. In some case, wilting may not occur. First symptoms  are a chlorosis of lower leaves which later turn brown. Infected plants  are stunted with flowers reduced in size. Control same as for Fusarium  Wilt."
,Chrysanthemum,Collar or Stem Rot," (fungi – , spp., , spp., , spp.): Stem turns dark at soil line, entire stem is girdled and plant  turns yellow and dies. Control measures include use of sterilized soil,  disease-free cuttings, proper drainage and use of a soil drench."
,Chrysanthemum,Powdery Mildew," (fungus – ,):  Foliage covered with a whitish, ash-gray powdery growth. With severe  infectious leaves may become distorted and stunted. Regular foliar  fungicide applications will control this disease."
,Chrysanthemum,Leaf Spots," (fungi – , spp., , spp., , spp., and others): Small yellow spots that gradually enlarge increasing  to one inch in diameter. Center of spots turn brown. Infection takes  place on lower leaves first. Regular applications of a foliar fungicide  for control."
,Chrysanthemum,Leaf or Foliar Nematode," (nematode – ,):  Yellowish-brown spotting of the leaves. Spots are bounded by larger  veins. Spots coalesce until entire leaf is affected. Leaves die and  fall. Symptoms start at base and progress up plant. Avoid wet humid  conditions, do not water from top. Use a peat mulch. Use disease-free  propagating material. Phosphate insecticides will control nematode on  plant."
,Chrysanthemum,Other Diseases,": See appropriate sections on ,, ,, ,, ,, and ,."
,Carnation, spp.,
,Carnation,Fusarium Wilt," (fungus – , f. spp. ,):  First symptoms are a slow wilting of shoots, often on only one side of  the plant. Wilting is accompanied by a discoloration of leaves, at first  a light gray-green and finally a pale yellow color. When stems of  diseased plants are split, a brown discoloration or streaks are evident  in the vascular tissues. Symptoms develop rapidly and are more severe  during periods of high temperatures. Most effective methods of control  are propagation of disease-free cuttings and complete sterilization of  potting soil, tools and benches."
,Carnation,Rhizoctonia Stem Rot," (fungus – ,):  Foliage gradually becomes pale and wilted. A wet rot of the bark occurs  at the soil line. Rot in the cortex is dry and corky with formations of  sclerotia in the center of the stem. Soil sterilization and soil  drenches with fungicides are effective methods of control."
,Carnation,Leaf Spot," (fungus – ,):  Small circular light-brown spots with purplish brown border. Occurs on  leaves and stems especially on lower portions of the plant. Small black  specks (fruiting bodies) develop in the center of the spots. Tips of the  leaves may die. Regular applications of a foliar fungicide spray in the  greenhouse will control the disease."
,Carnation,Storage Rot or Botrytis Blight," (fungus – ,):  Primarily a disease of cut flowers. Petals of infected flowers turn  brown. May also cause a watersoaked flecking of the outer petals. Will  also cause a soft rot of stem ends. Disease usually prevalent under high  humidity. Spray or dips will effectively control this disease."
,Carnation,Other Diseases,": See the appropriate sections on , (virus), , , spp, and see the section on ,."
,Carnation,Streak," (bacterium – , spp.): This bacterial disease usually starts at flowering time causing  purplish-brown streaks on the stems, beginning from the base and  extending upwards. The petioles, flowers, flower stalks, and pods are  also streaked. Small round spots appear on the leaves running together  gradually until the whole leaf is affected. Leaves may become dark brown  or be entirely destroyed. Since this bacteria may be carried on the  seed, chemical seed treatments and clean seed are advisable."
,Carnation,Other Bacterial Diseases,": This host is also subject to crown gall caused by (bacterium – ,) and leaf spot caused by (bacterium – , pv. ,)."
,Carnation,Mosaic," (Pea Mosaic Virus): Leaves are mottled, curled and yellowish. Flower  stalks are short and flowers are streaked with white. Remove and burn  infected plants. Control aphids which spread the disease."
,Carnation,Spotted Wilt," (Tomato Spotted Wilt Virus – TSWV): Purplish spots on the stems and  leaves develop after the leaves are mottled. Discolored or bleached  spots may appear on the blossoms. Since the disease is carried by  thrips, control the thrips and destroy all infected plants. Bud Drop  Disease: This disease is due entirely to faulty culture; it results in  the production of soft succulent growth and a lowered carbohydrate  accumulation. A deficiency of phosphorus and potassium in the soil,  coupled with low light intensity, are believed to aggravate the  condition. If possible, provide extra light in the greenhouse during  cloudy weather. Avoid overwatering and overfeeding with high nitrogenous  fertilizers."
,Canna, spp.,
,Canna,Rhizome Rot," (fungus – , and , spp.): These organisms cause rhizomes to decay and stems to rot at the  base. A cottony fungal growth may be present in rhizome rot."
,Canna,Bacterial Bud Rot," (bacterium – ,):  Young shoots and leaves may be killed. Control of these organisms is  through selection of healthy rootstocks. Damaged roots should be  discarded. Plantings should be thinned periodically and replanted to  increase vigor."
,Canna,Mosaic, (virus): Irregular light- and  dark-green areas in leaves. Plants may be stunted and late in flowering.  Destroy infected plants and control aphids. The variety – President is  immune.
,Canna,Other Diseases,": Include Fungal Leaf Spot (, spp.) and Root Knot Nematodes (, spp.)."
,Candelabra Cactus,,
,Candelabra Cactus,Stem Rot," (fungus – ,): A disease of ,,  especially when grown in greenhouses. The disease begins on the upper  end of the branch and moves downward. Rotted areas are dark colored and  soft. Once a branch is attacked it usually dies. The disease resembles a  bacterial decay, but no foul odor is present. Black fruiting bodies of  the fungus can be seen in the infected areas. The fungus becomes  established in greenhouses and is spread by splashing water. Damaged or  wounded plant are quickly infected. Control by eliminating diseased  plants and water without splashing."
,Cacti and Succulents,Many genera and species,
,Cacti and Succulents,Cactus Anthracnose," (fungus – , spp.): This disease affects several kinds of cacti, Cereus,  Echinocactus, Mammillaria, and particularly Opuntia (prickly pear).  Infection results in a rather moist light brown rot which shows many  light pink pustules on the surface. Spots are small at first, later  enlarge and become covered by the small spore-producing pustules. Large  areas may be affected, sometimes destroying entire plants. No  satisfactory control is available, other than removing and destroying  diseased cladodes as soon as noticed. In the greenhouse, soil from  infected plants should be removed and benches disinfected. Spraying with  a copper fungicide may help in checking the disease."
,Cacti and Succulents,Charcoal Spot," (fungus – ,):  Charcoal spot is a common and destructive disease of Opuntia in Texas.  Small spots, usually one-fourth inches or more in diameter, appear  first. The spots are surrounded by a ring of small raised dots that are  the fruiting structures. Spots later enlarge, but remain separated.  There is no control for infected plants. Remove and destroy diseased  specimens."
,Cacti and Succulents,Dry Rot," (fungi – , and , spp.): Small black circular spots develop first, which later increase  in size until they reach a diameter of one or two inches. Further  advance is checked by the development of callus tissue. Minute fruiting  structures are seen in the infected tissue. The disease is in part  physiological, influenced chiefly by soil moisture. Remove and destroy  diseased specimens."
,Cacti and Succulents,Scorch or Sunscald," (fungus – ,):  This disease is common and serious on prickly pear cactus (Opuntia).  Spots at first are distinctly zoned, later enlarging until entire  cladodes turn a reddish-brown and finally die. The center of the disease  area is grayish-brown and cracked. Other fungi may also be present in  the diseased area. No practical control has been developed."
,Cacti and Succulents,Cotton Root Rot," (fungus – ,):  Several members of the cactus family are susceptible to attack by the  cotton root rot fungus. Infected plants die. When pulled from the soil  the brown strands of the fungus can be found growing on the root  surface. No control practice is available. For additional information,  see the section on ,."
,Cacti and Succulents,Soft Rot," (bacterium – ,): The  bacterium enters tissue through natural openings and wounds. Under  conditions of high humidity, the bacteria reproduce quickly, spreading  to healthy parts of the plant. Diseased tissue is watery, soft, black  and deteriorates rapidly. If environmental conditions turn dry, the  development of the disease may be checked. The best control is to avoid  wounds, treat broken surfaces right away with a copper fungicide and  avoid having plants in places where humidity is high."
,Cacti and Succulents,Nematodes," (, spp.): Most of the cacti and succulents are susceptible to infection by  root knot nematodes. Infected roots show small galls which are typical  of the disease and serve to identify it when clean, washed roots are  observed. Fumigate or sterilize soil before potting. for additional  information, see the section on ,."
,Cacti and Succulents,"Other Diseases,Fusarium oxysporum"," (fungi): Other fungi known to cause disease on cacti are , (Fusarium rot), , (Charcoal rot), , spp., ,, and , (Stem and branch rot)."
,Cacti and Succulents,Scab," (physiological): Particularly common on prickly pear cactus. Rusty  colored, corky areas appear on the stems. Scab is thought to be a form  of edema, resulting from overwatering and poor ventilation. Increase  light and decrease humidity for control."
,Cacti and Succulents,Stem Rot of Cacti," (fungus – ,):  Basal or top rot of seedling cacti that turns cactus into a shrunken  mummy covered with brown spores. First symptoms are yellow spots. It can  completely rot a plant in four days. The fungicide Captan should give  some control."
,Begonia,spp.,
,Begonia,Stem and Root Rot," (fungi – , spp., , spp. and others): Affected plants wilt and break over at the soil line  due to decayed spots being formed on stems. This problem is often severe  when cuttings are placed in beds for rooting. Fungi responsible for  this condition may be introduced on cuttings or be present in soil. Use  sterilized soil. Fungicides may be used as a drench. Use cuttings from  healthy plants only."
,Begonia,Botrytis Blight and Stem Rot," (fungus – ,):  This fungus is most severe when temperatures are cool and moisture  levels are high. Affected plants decline rapidly with stems and leaves  developing brown, water-soaked lesions. In advanced stages all tissues  may be penetrated by the fungus. This disease is especially severe under  greenhouse conditions where begonias are propagated. Growers should be  sure to start with disease-free cuttings, use a sterilized medium and  keep the growing area free of any type of weak or decaying plant  material that might serve as a food source for the fungus."
,Begonia,Leaf Spots, (fungi – several): Brown spots appear on foliage and reduce plant  vigor. Most leaf spotting fungi thrive under high moisture conditions.  Change the location of potted plants if conditions are overly wet and  use appropriate protectant fungicides.
,Begonia,Powdery Mildew," (fungus – ,):  Affected leaves have a white powdery substance on the upper surfaces.  This problem is occasional in nature but may occur when environmental  conditions are ideal for disease development."
,Begonia,Bacterial Spot," (bacterium – ,, pv. ,):  Small blister-like spots appear on leaves. These become clear with age  and may run together to form larger spots. Affected leaves may shed  prematurely. Chemical control may be only partially effective."
,Begonia,Root Knot," (nematode – , spp.): This nematode causes knots to form on roots. This problem can be  prevented by using nematode-free planting stock and a sterilized  potting medium."
,Begonia,Rust," (fungus – ,): Orange-red  pustules form on the underside of leaves. In severe cases, foliage turns  yellow and dies. Alternate host is pine where it produces a blister  rust on the needles. Use rust resistant varieties when available.  Fungicides should be used at the first sign of disease and continued on a  7-14 day schedule."
,Begonia,Aster Yellows," (mycoplasma): First  symptoms are observed as a yellowing or chlorotic appearance along the  veins of young leaves. As the chlorosis becomes severe, defoliation  occurs. Affected plants do not wilt or die, but have a spindly type  growth which detracts from the plants overall appearance. Yellows may  attack only a portion of the plant. Secondary shoots are formed  profusely on infected plants. The disease is spread by leafhoppers.  Control is obtained by insect control and removal of diseased plants."
,Aster,spp.,
,Aster,Leaf Spots," (fungus – , spp., , spp., , spp., , spp., , spp.): Leaf spots may form in any stage of growth. Flower parts and  stems may also be affected. Older leaves are generally affected first.  Foliage may gradually wither and die starting with the lower leaves.  Overhead sprinkling or watering will increase severity of disease.  Spores of the causal organisms may be seed borne and use of seed  treatment fungicides will reduce disease incidence. Planting in wet,  poorly drained areas should be avoided. Foliar fungicides should be  applied at the first sign of disease and continued at 7-10 day  intervals."
,Aster,Foot Rot," (fungus – ,):  A rapid, permanent wilting of the leaves and a brownish-black  discoloration appears on the lower portion of the stem. The stem may  shrivel and collapse at or near the ground line. Roots may be affected  by a soft, water-soaked decay. Adventitious roots may form close to  diseased portions of the roots. Diseased plants are pulled easily from  the soil, but outer bark of the roots sloughs off and remains in the  soil. Plant only in well drained soils. This disease is soilborne and  once the soil is infested, asters should not be replanted."
,Aster,Root and Stem Rot," (fungus- ,):  The fungus may attack roots, stems and lower leaves. Symptoms on lower  leaves first appear on those leaves in contact with the soil. Affected  leaves are characterized by a well defined water-soaked area that  progresses rapidly during cool, moist conditions. At first, the leaf is a  dark green; it then wilts and turns dark brown. The stem and root may  also be attacked directly. The infected area is first water-soaked in  appearance; it later becomes sunken and turns a dark reddish-brown.  Control is best obtained by planting only in sterilized beds. Beds  should be well drained. Soil fungicides applied as a drench around  infected plants may be effective."
,Aster,Wilt," (fungus – , f.spp. ,):  Both young and old plants may be affected. Young plants wilt and die  rapidly. Older plants may exhibit two types of symptoms. One side of a  plant may be stunted with a yellowing of the lower leaves on that side.  When the stem is cut, a brown discoloration of the vascular tissue is  found on the infected side of the plant. In the second type of symptom,  lower leaves are yellow and wilt. This is followed by wilting and death  of the entire plant. Generally this occurs when the plant is in full  bloom. The lower portion of the stem may be dark brown when the stem is  cut. Most effective means of control is with the use of wilt resistant  varieties such as Gem mixed, or Dwarf Queen."
,Aster,Powdery Mildew," (fungus – ,): This  disease is characterized by a white, powdery growth on the upper leaf  surface. Older leaves may be affected with little distortion but young  leaves become twisted and misshapen. Young growing portions of the plant  may be completely infected resulting in dwarfing and curling of the  leaves, stems and buds. Often infected buds fail to open. Effective  control requires spraying plants with a recommended fungicide at the  first sign of disease."
,Amaryllis,,
,Amaryllis,Leaf Scorch or Red Blotch," (fungus – ,):  Flower stalks are affected resulting in their being distorted and  stunted. Affected stalks have bright red lesions that are one-fourth to  one-half inches wide and several inches long. Affected flower stalks  grow at an angle instead of the normal erect manner. In the later stages  of infection, a white to brownish-gray mycelium develops in the center  of cankers. The fungus is carried over in bulbs and discolored bulbs  should be discarded. Foliar fungicides may be used to protect  above-ground parts."
,Amaryllis,Bulb Rots," (fungi – , spp., , spp., , spp., , spp. and others): Bulb rots caused by fungi are quite common. The fungi  may enter the outer scales and progress inward until all scales are  infected. Bulbs showing signs of infection should be discarded to  prevent contamination of the beds. Soil sterilization with chemicals or  with steam may also be helpful."
,Amaryllis,Mosaic, (virus): Infected  plants are stunted and have yellow mottled leaves. The mottle becomes  more severe with stunting of all plant parts as time progresses. There  is no chemical control and once a plant becomes infected it will remain  that way throughout its life. Infected plants should be destroyed.
,Amaryllis,Southern Blight," (fungus – ,):  A white fungal growth appears at the ground line and infects the plant  at that point. Damage results in death of the above-ground portions.  Small bead-like structures (sclerotia) appear among the white fungal  strands and serve as overwintering bodies for the fungus. A drench with a  soil fungicide is usually sufficient to correct the problem. Avoid the  accumulation of plant residue around the plant base."
,African Violet (Staintpaulia),,
,African Violet (Staintpaulia),Crown Rot," (fungi – , spp., , spp., , spp.): Crown rot is probably the most serious disease of African  violets and may cause loss of entire groups of plants. Older leaves  droop and younger leaves showing stunting. Roots are killed rapidly and  appear brown. Unless treatment is administered before massive root  death, the plant will have to grow an entirely new root system before  recovery occurs. Two alternatives are available for infected plants: One  is to discard all affected and exposed plants and the other is to use  fungicide drenches. Drenches should be administered when the first  evidence of disease occurs. Caution should be used in getting the right  dosage levels since excessive levels of some chemicals may damage  plants. Preventive measures include using sterilized soil and avoiding  plant introductions that may harbor crown rot organisms."
,African Violet (Staintpaulia),Botrytis Blight," (fungus – ,):  Leaves, flowers and petioles develop small water-soaked spots that  enlarge rapidly. A grayish fungal growth may be seen upon close  examination of diseased tissue. The disease is more severe when  atmospheric conditions are cool and damp, poor air circulation exists  and when light intensity is low. All disease tissue should be removed as  this serves as a source for new spores. Surface sterilize the area  surrounding the plants with a household cleaner or bleach."
,African Violet (Staintpaulia),Powdery Mildew," (fungus – , spp.): A white powdery type substance may be observed on leaves,  petioles, petals or flower stems. It is more easily seen on dark  blossoms than white ones even though the white varieties may be slightly  more susceptible. Spores of the fungus are air-borne from one plant to  another. Control with fungicides is very effective. If the systemic  fungicide is used, one may have to spray blossoms since the fungicide is  not translocated to floral parts when the pot drench method is  employed."
,African Violet (Staintpaulia),Petiole Rot," (Physiogenic): An orange to brown,  rust colored spot appears where the petiole touches the pot. The petiole  and leaf may collapse. This damage results from salt accumulation on  the rim of the pot and the soil surface. Use rain water or another  salt-free source of water and avoid over fertilization. Construct a  collar from aluminum foil to be fitted around the rim of the pot."
,African Violet (Staintpaulia),Ring Spot," (Physiogenic): Light brown rings form on leaves with  some running together to form irregularly shaped spots. This condition  is caused by cold water coming in contact with the leaves. In some  cases, damage may occur even if warm water is used. Such a possibility  exists when a breeze blows across the wet area and produces an  evaporative effect. Water should be kept off leaves."
,African Violet (Staintpaulia),Root Knot," (nematode – , spp.): Galls form on roots of plants causing the root system to be  inefficient in absorbing and translocating water and nutrients. This  condition can be prevented by using nematode free propagating stock and a  sterilized potting medium. The nematode may also be transmitted by  petiole cuttings from infected plants. Do not use infected plants for  propagation."
,African Violet (Staintpaulia),Crown Gall," (bacterium – ,):  Fleshy galls form around the base of the plant with a profusion of  leaves being produced at that point. Natural infection seems to be  slight but infected tissue is perpetuated by some who sell this unusual  looking plant under the name of “Witchcraft”. Infected plants should be  discarded."
,African Violet (Staintpaulia),Viruses, (virus – several): Infected plants have  distorted leaves that are mottled in color. Infected plants are not  killed but should be discarded because they may serve as a possible  source of infection for other plants.
,Wisteria,spp. ,
,Wisteria,Crown Gall," (bacterium – ,):  This soil-borne bacterium will sometimes infect wisteria, causing galls  or swellings on the main roots or stems. Inspect plants before buying  and discard any plants with knots, galls, or swellings on the roots.  (See the section on ,)"
,Wisteria,Leaf Spots," (fungi – ,):  Different fungi may cause leaf spots on wisteria. Pick off and destroy  spotted leaves. Fungicide applications are normally not necessary."
,Wisteria,Powdery Mildew," (fungus –,):  A white-grayish mold develops on the surface of the leaves. Spray with a  protective fungicide if the disease occurs frequently."
,Wisteria,Root Knot Nematode," (nematode – , spp.): (See the section on ,)"
,Wisteria,Cotton Root Rot," (fungus – ,): , is moderately susceptible to cotton root rot."
,Wisteria,,
,Pyracantha,spp.,
,Pyracantha,Scab," (fungus – ,):  Affects both the foliage and berries. It first shows up on foliage as  small, greenish-yellow spots which later turn black. The berries are  marked by small, black scabby spots. The disease is favored by long  periods of intermittent rains and mild temperatures. Primary infection  is from the previous year’s foliage. Control is obtained by following a  regular spray program and sanitation through removal of plant residues."
,Pyracantha,Fire Blight," (bacterium – ,):  Causes twig dieback and blossom blight. Infected blossoms wilt and turn  black rapidly. The disease progresses from the blossoms into the  vascular system where it causes extensive twig death. The foliage does  not abscise due to the rapid rate of death. Twig blight is common and  can result in dieback ranging up to 12-24 inches of twig length. Dark  sunken areas or cankers are formed on the twigs. Bacteria overwinter in  the cankers. In the spring, bacteria ooze from the cankers and are  carried by wind, rain and insects to healthy foliage. Shrubs which have  fire blight should be pruned to remove infected material. Make cuts four  inches below visible cankers. All pruning equipment should be  sterilized between cuts with a one part household bleach to nine parts  of water. Avoid high nitrogen levels."
,Pyracantha,Sooty Mold,": Black,  powdery mold in patches or covering entire upper leaf surfaces. A  non-parasitic growth resulting from infestations of aphids or other  sucking insects. Use effective insect control."
,Pyracantha,Root Rots," (fungus): Tip burn and/or marginal burn of leaves, often followed by  branch dieback or death of entire plant. Frequently associated with  poorly drained or waterlogged soils. (See the sections on , and ,)"
,Poinsettia,,
,Poinsettia,Gray Mold," (fungus – ,):  This disease is especially serious on double varieties. The  inflorescence, leaves and stems are attacked. A gray mold occurs on the  inflorescence causing a blasting and browning of the flower clusters and  colored bracts. Water-soaked lesions will appear on leaves and stems.  In the later stages of the leaf and stem disorder, the lesions become  dry and crisp."
,Poinsettia,Cotton Root Rot," (fungus – ,):  Cotton root rot is restricted to extreme South Texas where Poinsettias  are planted in landscapes. In most areas of Texas, Poinsettias will not  survive winter temperatures. (See the section on ,)"
,Poinsettia,Scab," (fungus – ,):  A very common disease of poinsettia, particularly in South Texas. The  fungus attacks leaves and stems, starting out as conspicuous, raised  lesions or cankers on diseased stems. The cankers are at first white,  later turning gray. Frequently, these cankers unite to cover irregular  raised areas which give the plants an unsightly appearance. The disease  cannot be controlled once it is well established on plants. Severely  diseased plants should be cut back and the new growth should be  protected with a fungicide."
,Poinsettia,Black Leg," (fungus – ,):  This disease can affect poinsettias at any stage of growth, but it is  usually more prevalent right after the plants are potted. Stems affected  by Rhizoctonia become dark-brown, water-soaked, with lesions that  extend above and below the soil line. The lesion may encircle the stem,  causing the stem to become weak. As a result of the black leg condition,  the foliage becomes pale yellow and some of the leaves fall off. If  roots and stems become severely infected, the plants die suddenly.  Drenching the soil with a fungicide around the base of the plants may  help in checking this disease."
,Poinsettia,Pythium Root Rot," (fungus – , sp.): Roots and basal portions of the stem turn brown and soft. Foliage  may wilt rapidly. Pythium root rot is a major problem in commercial  poinsettia production. Control measures consist of fungicide treatment  of soil mix, fungicide drenches, acquisition of clean planting stock,  and using a potting medium that drains well."
,Pittosporum,,
,Pittosporum,Cercospora Leaf Spot," (fungus – ,):  Small, angular-shaped, yellowish-to-brownish spots. Spots may coalesce  to form large irregular spots.

Control is best obtained by protective spraying with recommended  fungicides."
,Pittosporum,Leaf Spots," (fungi – , sp.): Small, circular dark-brown necrotic spots surrounded by chlorotic  areas. Generally affects shrubs in poor physiological condition.  Control is best obtained by maintaining shrubs in good growing  condition. Applications of a protective fungicide are effective."
,Pittosporum,Cotton Root Rot," (fungus – ,):  Plants suddenly wilt and die. When plants are pulled from the soil, the  outer bark is decayed. Rhizomorphs of the fungus may be observed. (See  the section on ,)"
,Pittosporum,Root Knot Nematode," (fungus – , sp.): Plants usually lack vigor, are often stunted and pale yellow.  Plants may wilt quickly under moisture stress. Roots have small-to-large  swellings, galls or knots. These are generally spherical and cannot be  easily removed from the roots. (See the section on ,)"
,Pittosporum,Virus,":  Three virus diseases, a mosaic on the leaves, one which causes a  variegation of the leaves and one which causes rough bark have been  reported on ,."
,Pittosporum,Southern Blight," (fungus – ,): Reported in Texas."
,Photinia,spp.,
,Photinia,Leaf Spots," (fungi – ,):  Spray at 7-10 day intervals during wet or humid weather with a  recommended fungicide. Expanded, brown and often zoned spots on the  leaves. The leaf spots may be round-to-irregular, purple, then  gray-to-brown with purple margins in which black specks can later be  found."
,Photinia,Powdery Mildew," (fungi – , and ,):  Dust or spray with approved powdery mildew fungicide when mildew first  appears. Repeat at 10-14 day intervals as long as necessary. Preventive  sprays in following years would produce better control."
,Photinia,Cotton Root Rot,": (See the section on ,)"
,Photinia,Mushroom Root Rot:," (See the section on ,)"
,Photinia,Root Knot Nematode:," (See the section on ,)"
,Photinia,Fire Blight," (bacterium – ,):  Leaves, stems and fruit are blighted by this bacterium. New shoots  suddenly appear as if scorched by fire. Brown or blackened leaves cling  to twigs. Slightly sunken, girdling, discolored cankers develop on  twigs, branches and trunk. Follow the same control procedures  recommended for pears."
,Nandina,,
,Nandina,Leaf Spots," (fungi – ,):  Small, circular spots develop on the foliage. Lesion is brown-to-dark  brown with reddish halo. Fungicides not required. Sanitation will help  reduce foliage infection."
,Nandina,Ring Spot," (virus): Light green or  yellow, irregular rings occur in leaves. Plants tend to be smaller and  low in vigor. Destroy diseased plants. Propagate from healthy plants."
,Nandina,Iron Chlorosis, (nutrient deficiency): Foliage becomes light green and finally a  greenish yellow. The veins tend to remain green. Foliar applications of  iron sulfate or copperas are usually effective if several applications  are made when leaves are forming. For mid- or late season corrections of  a severe deficiency apply iron chelates such as Geigy 330 Fe (Central  Texas) or Geigy 138 Fe (West and Far West Texas).

,Gardenia (Cape Jasmine),,
,Gardenia (Cape Jasmine),Canker," (fungus – ,):  One of the most common gardenia diseases. The main stem is swollen near  or below the soil line. The bark becomes corky and contains numerous  longitudinal cracks in the cankered area. The stem above the canker is  bright yellow in contrast to normal greenish white. If the humidity is  high, a yellowish exudate may be seen on the surface. Affected plants  are stunted and die slowly. Destroy all diseased plants to prevent  spread of the disease. Place new plants in a different location. Disease  is easily spread on propagating knives."
,Gardenia (Cape Jasmine),Bacterial Leaf Spot," (bacteria – ,, ,):  Small, rounded ovoid spots on young tender leaves. As the spots  enlarge, the center is at first pale yellow and later become  reddish-brown surrounded by a yellow halo. Margins of the lesions are  thickened and water-soaked in appearance. Spots may coalesce to form  large, irregular-shaped spots. Severe infection may cause defoliation.  Avoid overhead watering. The disease is spread by taking cuttings from  infected plants. Use sterilized soil and pots."
,Gardenia (Cape Jasmine),Rhizoctonia Leaf Spot," (fungus – , spp.): Leaves have tan to brown spots up to one-fourth inch in  diameter. Spots are circular and zoned. The disease begins on the older  leaves and spreads upward when the plants are watered excessively or  when air circulates poorly because of overcrowding. Diseased leaves  should be destroyed and sterilized soil should be used. Disease-free  plants should be used for propagation. Avoid wetting foliage when  watering."
,Gardenia (Cape Jasmine),Leaf Spot," (fungi – , spp., , spp.): Spots of various sizes on leaves throughout the year. Spots may  be small, dark-brown necrotic areas surrounded by a yellow halo. In  severe cases, premature leaf drop may occur. control is obtained by  spraying with a foliar fungicide at regular intervals."
,Gardenia (Cape Jasmine),Sooty Mold," (fungus – , spp.): Black, thin layers of the fungus form over the upper surface of  leaves. Sooty mold is caused by a fungus that grows on sugary exudate  from white flies. Control white fly."
,Gardenia (Cape Jasmine),,
,Gardenia (Cape Jasmine),Powdery Mildew," (fungus – ,): White powdery spots on leaves. Use preventive fungicide."
,Gardenia (Cape Jasmine),Other Diseases,": See the sections on ,, ,, ,, and ,."
,Ligustrum,spp.,
,Ligustrum,"Anthracnose,The following varieties are resistant:"," (fungus – ,):  Leaves dry out and cling to the stem. Twigs are blighted and cankers  are formed at the base of the main stem. cankers may be spotted with  pinkish pustules. The bark and wood of diseased portions become brown  and the bark on the cankers may split, exposing the wood, Death occurs  when the cankers completely encircle the twigs or stems. , ,. For climates in which winter killing is not a factor, the California privet is preferred for planting."
,Ligustrum,Green Scurf," (alga – ,):  Green scurf or algal leaf spot appears on twigs and limbs. Spray or  dust with a copper fungicide recommended for general use on ornamental  plants being careful to cover the underside of the leaves. Add a  spreader-sticker to the spray."
,Ligustrum,Leaf Spots," (fungi – ,):  Brown or dark colored spots occur on the leaf. Generally not serious.  Usually occurs during very rainy seasons or more frequently in  overcrowded, poorly aerated plantings. Most prevalent just before normal  fall of old leaves."
,Ligustrum,Sooty Mold,: A blackish growth occurs on the leaves. Commonly follows white fly infestation. Control white flies.

,Ligustrum,Root Knot Nematode,": (See the section on ,)"
,Ligustrum,Winter Injury,": See section on ,."
,Ligustrum,Gall," (fungus – , sp.): Galls develop rapidly reaching a diameter of one and one-half  inches within five and one-half months. These galls are commonly  mistaken for bacterial galls. Prune out the galls. Pruning shears need  not be sterilized as they will not infect a pruning cut."
,Euonymous,spp.,
,Euonymous,Powdery Mildew," (fungi – , and ,):  Powdery mildew is the most common and possibly the most difficult  disease to control on Euonymous. It forms a flat, whitish growth on the  leaves which can be easily rubbed off. Leaves may yellow slightly and  drop off, but heavy defoliation is not a characteristic symptom. The  fungus only invades the epidermal cells and, thus, leaves normally stay  attached long after they are infected. Preventing infection of the new  growth in the spring and planting in a proper site are keys to  controlling powdery mildew. Cultural controls include: (1) planting in a  sunny area; (2) not crowding the plants; (3) avoiding overhead  watering; (4) pruning out and destroying heavily disease branches; and  (5) raking and destroying fallen leaves. Chemical applications should  begin before new foliage is infected. Fungicides will protect foliage  from infection but will not remove the dense, white fungal growth from  infected leaves. Adding a wetting agent to the spray solution will  greatly improve coverage. Liquid household detergents make good wetting  agents when one teaspoon is added for each gallon of spray solution."
,Euonymous,Crown Gall," (bacterium – ,):  Large, rounded galls with an irregular rough surface, appear on roots  or stems. Plants lack vigor and may die back. Avoid wounding stems or  roots. Prune out and destroy affected plant parts. Sterilize pruning  shears in 90% alcohol or 10% bleach after each cut. Dig up and destroy  severely affected plants."
,Euonymous,Anthracnose," (fungus – , spp.): Symptoms consist of small, brownish spots on the leaves with  light colored centers. Tiny cracks in the leaf spots indicate fruiting  structures of the fungus. Overhead watering makes the disease worse and  considerable defoliation can result. Fungicide applications will help  control this disease."
,Euonymous,Leaf Spots," (fungi – ,, ,, ,):  Various sizes and colored spots on leaves. Collect and burn fallen  leaves. Prune to thin out shrubs. Protect with fungicide sprays when  needed."
,Euonymous,Cotton Root Rot," (fungus – ,): Plants suddenly wilt and die. when plants are removed from the soil, the bark on the roots is decayed. (See the section on ,)"
,Euonymous,Oedema," (physiological): Small, raised masses of tissue on the underside of  leaves. the raised mass of tissue later becomes rough and corky. May  sometimes occur on stems. Control by reducing moisture level. In  greenhouses, reduce humidity, improve air circulation and avoid  overwatering during overcast periods."
,Eleaeagnus,spp.,
,Eleaeagnus,Wet Feet," (physiological): Elaeagnus (Russian olive) is a hardy woody shrub with  few disease problems. It is, however, vulnerable to excessively wet  soils. Elaeagnus should be planted on well-drained sites and not in low  spots or in soils that retain water."
,Eleaeagnus,Leaf Spots," (fungi – ,, ,, ,, ,):  Spots may vary in size, color and shape. These fungi are rarely severe  enough to warrant control measures. Prune out heavily infected foliage  if it becomes unsightly."
,Eleaeagnus,Southern Blight," (fungus – ,): Southern blight primarily attacks , in the seedling stage. Plants usually wilt as the stems rot at or below  the soil line. A white, cottony mold may be evident on the lower stems  near the ground line. Brown fruiting bodies (sclerotia) are often  scattered through the cottony fungus growing on the stem. This disease  does not normally attack older plants."
,Eleaeagnus,Cotton Root Rot," (fungus –,):  As with most woody ornamentals, elaeagnus will die quite rapidly when  infected with the cotton root rot fungus. Plants will die so rapidly  that leaves are not shed but are retained on the plant. Cutting the base  of the plant with a knife soon after it dies will show that the base of  the plant and the roots died before the upper part of the plant. The  woody portion of the crown will be darker than in the branches and  stems. No controls are known."
,Crapemyrtle,,
,Crapemyrtle,Powdery Mildew," (fungus – ,):  Powdery mildew is very common on crapemyrtle. It is particularly active  in the spring and fall months. White-to-grayish moldy growth develops  on leaves and new shoots. Dust or spray with a recommended fungicide at  first appearance of mildew. Dallas red is an old variety with good  mildew resistance. Check on availability of newer varieties with mildew  resistance."
,Crapemyrtle,Leaf Spots," (fungi – , spp., , spp.): Leaf spot fungi seldom cause severe damage. If needed, apply a recommended fungicide."
,Crapemyrtle,Cotton Root Ro,"t: (See the section on ,)"
,Crapemyrtle,Mushroom Root Rot,": See section on (See the section on ,)"
,Cotoneaster,spp.,
,Cotoneaster,Fire Blight," (bacterium –,):  New shoots suddenly appear as if scorched by fire. Brown or blackened  leaves cling to twigs. Slightly sunken, girdling, discolored cankers on  twigs, branches and trunk. Prune and burn affected parts."
,Cotoneaster,Leaf Spots," (fungi – ,, ,): With ,,  leaves will have reddish-brown spots bordered by darker zones, outside  of which is a zone of dark red. There may also appear within the spots  small, black fruiting structures of the fungus."
,Cotoneaster,Canker," (fungus – ,): This fungus causes cankers and twig blight on cotoneaster. Prune and destroy infected branches."
,Cotoneaster,Cotton Root Rot," (fungus – ,): (See the section on ,)"
,Camellia,,
,Camellia,Canker and Dieback," (fungus – ,):  Sudden wilting of branches is usually the first indication of disease.  Gray blotches appear on bark of stem or branches. Underlying wood dies  and bark may split to form open wounds or cankers. Pinkish pustules or  spore masses may be seen in these cankers during moist periods. Leaves  on affected branches turn chlorotic and branch tips die back. Plant in  well-drained soil that has the proper pH and fertility level. Avoid  excessive nitrogen fertilization. When dieback occurs, prune out and  destroy diseased twigs. Prune several inches below visible canker, and  use a commercial wound dressing on all cuts. Spraying plants during wet  periods and during the period of normal leaf drop with a fungicide will  help control the disease."
,Camellia,Petal Blight," (fungus – ,):  Petal blight affects only the flower portion of the plant. The first  evidence of infection is the appearance of small, brown,  irregular-shaped spots on the petals. Affected petals have a “veined”  appearance and the tissue remains firm. Entire flower turns brown in  24-48 hours and usually drops. The disease generally occurs during the  spring. Remove and destroy all infected plant tissue. Apply fungicide to  the soil just prior to bloom to prevent germination of overwintering  spores. Thoroughly cover all areas under the plant and at least a 10  foot radius around each plant. Applications of a foliar fungicide at the  first sign of disease and at 7-14 day intervals is effective."
,Camellia,Leaf Gall," (fungus – ,):  Young leaves and buds may be infected. Leaves become thickened and  succulent and may be larger than normal. The color changes from light  green to nearly white. Little damage occurs but the plant appears  abnormal or diseased. Pick young galls and destroy. Spray with fungicide  before leaves open."
,Camellia,Leaf Spots," (fungi – ,, , and algae –,):  Various sized spots on the leaves. Small, black pinpoint dots may be in  the dead leaf areas. Control requires preventive fungicidal sprays at  two week intervals. Include a spreader sticker to increase effectiveness  of sprays."
,Camellia,Ring Spots, (virus): Occurs mostly in East Texas. Light green  or yellowish rings surround islands of green in the leaves. Destroy  diseased plants. Propagate from disease-free plants.
,Camellia,Yellow Mottle Leaf," (virus): Irregular, yellow patterns on some leaves. No cure available. Propagate from disease-free plants."
,Camellia,Bud Drop," (physiological): May occur as a result of overwatering, inadequate  moisture in the soil, insufficient light, excessively high temperatures,  severe freezing during the winter or a pot-bound condition of the  roots. Also, certain camellia varieties shed their unopened bloom buds  as a result of insufficient cold during the winter. Fertilize and water  properly. Keep plants healthy by controlling diseases and insects."
,Camellia,Oedema or Scab, (physiological): Corky bumps or raised areas on leaves. Usually due to excessive water in soil.
,Camellia,Sunburn, (physiological): Leaves have brown or faded green areas. Occurs on side  of bush directly hit by the sun. Particularly a problem on bushes  transplanted from a shaded to a sunny location.
,Camellia,,
,Azalea,spp.,
,Azalea,Anthracnose," – Leafspot and Dieback (fungus – ,):  Symptoms on leaves are characterized by numerous small, round spots on  both leaf surfaces. The spots are light to rusty-brown with a definite  margin. Under severe conditions, the spots may coalesce and form large  irregular spots. Premature defoliation may occur. Branches may suddenly  wilt and die. Upon close examination, stem cankers that have girdled the  stem may be observed. Pink pustules or spore masses may be seen in  these cankers during moist periods. Plant in well drained soil and avoid  excessive nitrogen fertilization. When dieback occurs, prune out and  destroy diseased twigs. Preventive sprays with a foliar fungicide are  effective."
,Azalea,Petal Blight," (fungus – ,):  The first evidence of infection is the appearance of small, brown  irregular-shaped spots on the petals. Spots are white on colored flowers  and brown on white flowers. Affected petals have a veined appearance  and remain firm. Flowers may have a freckled appearance. The flower  collapses and sticks to the foliage. Small, black fruiting bodies  (sclerotia) form on blighted flowers. Where flower blight has previously  occurred, spray soil and litter around plants with a recommended  fungicide four weeks before bloom. Spray at regular intervals during the  blooming period."
,Azalea,Leaf Spot," (fungi – , sp., , sp.): Spots of various sizes and color on leaves throughout the year.  Fungicidal sprays at 7-10 day intervals during periods of high humidity  will prevent serious foliage damage."
,Azalea,Leaf Gall," (fungus – , sp.): Distorted leaf and bud growth developing in April and may.  Affected parts later become covered with a whitish mold. Spray plants  with protective fungicide just before flower buds open and at 10 day  intervals until flowering ceases. Remove and burn affected parts."
,Azalea,Root and Crown Rot," (fungus – ,):  Affected plants may wilt suddenly and die or they may be unthrifty if  only a portion of the root system is infected. A brown discoloration of  the wood may be seen in the basal portions of the stems and in the main  roots. Plants are much more susceptible when planted in poorly drained  areas or planted too deeply. Plant only in well-drained and well-aerated  soil. Plant only as deep as the plants originally grew. Drench with a  soil fungicide before plants are seriously affected."
,Azalea,Physiological Disorders,":  Leaf margins and leaf tips turn brown. Plant are unthrifty or fail to  grow. Principal cause is improper soil moisture relationship; i.e., soil  allowed to become too dry or soil waterlogged to exclude oxygen.  Contributing factors may be salt toxicity from over-fertilization,  “root-bound” plants unable to develop normal root systems, soil  alkalinity due to leaching of lime from masonry of new residences or the  use of alkaline water from certain deep well sources. Select healthy  bushes with unrestricted root systems showing active growth for  planting. Plant in well-drained soil avoiding sites exposed to full  sunlight or to the west sun. Maintain high amount of organic matter in  soil and adequate mulch to preserve uniform soil moisture in the root  zone."
,Azalea,Chlorosis,: See section on chlorosis.
,Althea (Rose of Sharon),spp.,
,Althea (Rose of Sharon),Flower Bud Drop," (physiological): Open flowers and buds may drop suddenly when one  moisture extreme follows another. For example, drought stress followed  by adequate moisture may cause such drop. Other extremes in growing  conditions may also contribute. Avoid drought stress."
,Althea (Rose of Sharon),Leaf Spot," (fungi – , spp., , spp. and others): Circular spots occur on leaves which results in their  shedding from the plant. Use appropriate foliar fungicides to prevent  damage."
,Althea (Rose of Sharon),Root Knot Nematodes," (, spp.):  Knots or galls form on roots causing the plant to be inefficient in  absorbing water and nutrients. Leaves are small and the plants fail to  make normal growth. Use caution when planting to be sure that planting  stock is not infested. If yard soil is contaminated, plant shrub in a  large container of sterilized soil. This is probably the most serious  problem experienced by althea."
,Althea (Rose of Sharon),Cotton Root Rot," (fungus – ,):  Althea is very susceptible to attack by the cotton root rot fungus that  occurs in the soils of central Texas. If this disease is a problem in  the area, it may be necessary to grow the plant in a large container of  sterilized potting mix or soil."
,Althea (Rose of Sharon),Leaf Rust," (fungus – ,):  Infection by the leaf rust fungus causes chlorosis and leaf spotting.  Infection is characterized by yellow-orange pustules on the lower leaf  surface. Fungicide control is usually not necessary."

,Rose,"Cankers (Brand, Common, & Brown)","Fungus will form light brown to black, sunken or cracked lesions on the cane. Living tissue may surround the lesion and the lesion might girdle the cane killing all parts above it."
,Rose,Cotton Root Rot,"Infected plants die suddenly. Root bark is decayed and brownish, and bronze colored wooly strands of the fungus are frequently apparent on the root surface. Leaves will turn brown and remain attached to the shrub."
,Rose,Cylindrocladium Leaf and Stem Rot,Mainly a problem of greenhouse propagated roses. Cankers develop at the base of the affected stem. There is a distinct transition from the healthy part of the stem (green) to the diseased part of the stem (black). Will cause the plant to wilt suddenly.
,Rose,Crown Gall,"Woody galls form on lower stems and root tissue. If the gall girdles the lower stem or main roots, the plant may be killed."
,Rose,Downy Mildew,"This disease causes severe and rapid defoliation. The fungus is active only under cool, damp conditions. Leaf symptoms vary from angular blotches (yellow, purple to brown), to a scorch like burn. Under conditions of high humidity, a purplish-gray mass develops on the undersurfaces of the infected leaves."
,Rose,Mosaic Virus,"Variable yellow and green patterns occur on leaves. This can be in the form of yellow bands or ringspots, wavy lines, yellow vein banding, or splotches of yellow and green."
,Rose,Powdery Mildew,"A white powdery growth develops on leaves, buds and twigs causing them to be distorted and dwarfed. Growth is most often seen on the upper leaf surface, but can also be seen on the lower leaf surface. Young, tender growth is most susceptible."
,Rose,"Ro,ot Knot Nematode","Feed on the inside of the roots inducing knots or galls on them. These swellings are usually white and round to irregularly elongated. Foliage may wilt, appear stunted, and turn yellow to bronze."
,Rose,Rose Rosette,"The virus is transmitted by eriophyid mites. Symptoms include distorted, small leaves, short internodes, red pigmentation of foliage, excessive thorniness and proliferation of shoots (witches broom). Infected plants generally die within one year."
,Rose,Rust,"Rust is a rare problem but can cause serious defoliation. Small, raised, orange pustules occur on the lower leaf surface. Corresponding yellow spots occur on the upper surface. Depending on the spore stage, rust pustules can be orange, red or black."
,Rose,Spring Dwarf,Symptoms are noticed when leaves first emerge in the spring. Shortened internodes give a balled appearance. Leaves are short and curved. 
,Rose,Verticillium Wilt,Foliage will suddenly wilt and appear scorched or a single branch will defoliate. Vascular discoloration can be seen when a cross-section is taken of an infected branch. Colors range from brown to gray to green. Infected root tissue may also have discoloration.

,Sycamore,Botryodiplodia Canker," (fungus – ,):  This fungus is known generally as a weak or facultative parasite with a  wide host range. However, in Texas it has caused a rapid death of  sycamores. The fungus produces cankers on branches and the main stem. It  is favored by high temperatures and drought stress conditions. Trees  weakened by the Cephalosporium wilt fungus are more vulnerable to  attack. Broken terminals in twigs are the best places for the fungus to  enter. It has been a common problem in sycamores. Prune out dead and  dying branches below the cankers. Sterilize pruning tools with 10  percent bleach solution between cuts. Spraying for anthracnose with  benomyl will also help to control ,."
,Sycamore,Sycamore Anthracnose," (fungus – ,):  Sometimes called blight and scorch. A single attack seldom causes harm  but if the tree is infected several years in succession it will weaken a  tree, making it susceptible to borer attack and winter injury. The  first symptoms, sudden browning of single leaves or clusters, may be  confused with late frost injury. Later dead areas appear along or  between the veins, usually starting at the leaf edge. Leaves fall  prematurely when heavily infected and trees often remain bare until late  summer, when new leaves form. Infection of small twigs causes sunken  areas, called cankers, and slightly raised margins. When the canker  completely girdles the twig, killing it, this is called the shoot blight  stage. The fungus can overwinter in fallen infected leaves and in twig  cankers. In southern Texas it can pass the winter in the spore stage on  dormant buds. Severity of attack depends on weather conditions during  the two week period following leaf emergence. Frequent rains and cool  temperatures favor rapid spread. Below 55,F. injury will be severe and above 60,F,  little or no injury. Control: Prune out dead twigs in fall. Burn all  dead twigs and fallen leaves. Spray with recommended fungicide when  leaves unfurl, when leaves are half-grown, and when leaves are fully  grown. Trees repeatedly attacked should be well fertilized in spring to  increase their vigor."
,Sycamore,Leaf Spot," (fungi – ,, and ,):  Several fungi cause disease of minor importance that can be controlled  by the spray schedule suggested for control of anthracnose. ,:known  mainly in Texas. Irregular, dark brown to purple spots one-eighth to  one-fourth inch in diameter on the upper leaf surface. Often with a  brown center. Spots are brown with darker border on lower surface. Spots  may coalesce to produce a dirty-brown colored leaf. Defoliation may  occur."
,Sycamore,Powdery Mildew," (fungi – , and ,):  Makes appearance mainly in late summer. May be present on older growth  but usually most severe on new growth, which may be distorted, stunted,  and covered with a white growth and white spores."
,Sycamore,Canker-Stain Disease," (fungi – ,): It can be lethal to sycamore, but is much more important as a killing disease of London plane (,):  Since it is spread almost entirely by man, through pruning, it is  essentially a shade tree disease. Leaves are dwarfed and sparse in part  or all of the tree top. The staining cankers occur on trunks or  branches. The first symptom on the yellow or green bark is a brown to  black lens-shaped discoloration. Cankers may become 20 to 40 inches long  in one year, but usually only two inches wide. Cankers widen each year,  and often coalesce, girdling the tree or branch. Older cankers shed  their darkened, dead bark exposing the wood, which dries, cracks, and  turns black. The reddish-brown or bluish-black discoloration of the  wood, in cross section behind the cankers, is the most distinctive  symptom. Stain patterns are radial, generally reaching the pith. The  fungus sporulates abundantly on newly-killed wood in wet weather from  May until October. It produces two kinds of asexual spores; one, long  and clear; the other, short and brownish. It also produces a  long-necked, pear-shaped, sexual fruiting structure. Avoid injuring the  tree. Prune out dead limbs during winter. Be sure to dip the pruning  tool in 10 percent bleach solution before each cut to avoid spreading  the fungus. Treat cankers with protective paint."
,Sycamore,Sooty Blotch," (fungus – ,): Sometimes forms on shoots of sycamore. The dark surface mycelium can usually be rubbed off with the fingers."
,Sycamore,Mistletoe," (parasitic plant – ,): A seed-producing higher plant that parasitizes sycamore in the south."
,Sycamore,Shoestring Root Rot," (fungus – ,):  Two forms of the fungus can usually be found under the bark at ground  level. These are black “shoestring like” rhizomorphs and a white  fan-shaped fungus growth. (See section on ,)"
,Sycamore,Cotton Root Rot," (fungus – ,): (See section on ,)"
,Sycamore,Trunk Rots," (fungi – , sp., , sp.): Heart rot fungi can hollow out the entire central cylinder of a  tree. The tree declines in general and the presence of the fungus is  known when it fruits on the side of the tree. The annual fruiting  structure is a white, rounded, spongy mass with long, slender white  teeth on the bottom. There is no control – only prevention, by avoiding  wounding the tree. (,): This fungus enters wounds  and causes a white, mottled trunk rot. The tree declines in general and  the presence of the fungus is known when it produces a fruiting  structure from a wound. This hard, woody, shelf-like perennial structure  may attain a width of two or more feet. The upper surface is smooth,  zoned, and grayish or grayish black, whereas the undersurface is white  when fresh, but becomes yellowish with age. The undersurface turns brown  when bruised and is a favorite medium for artists. There is no control –  only prevention, by avoiding wounding of the tree."
,Redbud, spp.,
,Redbud,Canker," (fungus – ,):  The most destructive disease of redbud. Cankers begin as small sunken  areas and increase slowly in size. The bark in the center blackens and  cracks along the edges. The canker girdles the stem and the leaves above  wilt and die. Prune and burn branches with visible cankers."
,Redbud,Leaf Spot," (fungus – , with a , imperfect stage): The leaf spots are brown, circular to angular, from  one-eighth to one-fourth inch in diameter, often with a halo. Premature  defoliation may occur. Apply a fungicide labeled for general use on  trees and shrubs, at 10 day intervals when spots first appear and during  prolonged periods of wet weather."
,Redbud,Cotton Root Rot," (fungus – ,): Redbud is rated as highly susceptible to the cotton root rot fungus."
,Redbud,Verticillium Wilt," (fungus – ,): (See section on ,)"
,Pine, spp.,
,Pine,Annosus Root Rot," (fungus – ,):  Symptoms of this fungal disease are stunted needle growth, thinning of  needles in the crown and eventual death. Roots and butt of stems exhibit  a soft, stringy white rot. The fungus may produce perennial conks or  fruiting bodies at the base of the tree. The conks vary in shape from a  bracket to flat layers. These are gray-brown to dark brown on the upper  surface, creamy white underneath, and usually are not casually visible  due to covering by needle accumulations. The disease is most serious in  planted forests following thinning operations. Infections spread from  infected stumps to healthy trees through root grafts. Common borax  powder applied in salt shaker manner to surfaces of freshly cut stumps  prevents stump infection and subsequent spread to adjacent living trees.  A biological control has been developed but is not readily accessible.  Harvesting during dry summer and fall months lessens the possibility of  new infections."
,Pine,Brown Spot Needle Blight," (fungus – ,):  This disease is a problem on long leaf pine seedlings and Afghan pine  grown for Christmas trees. Symptoms first appear as irregularly circular  light gray-green spots on needles in the fall. Spots enlarge rapidly  and encircle the needle forming narrow tan-brownish bands, and finally  the tips of the needles die as a result of multiple infections. Many  needles may be killed the first season they are infected. The fungus  fruits on very small dark-brown to black colored elongated spots on the  dead part of the needle. Spores are produced in wet weather and the  needles may be attacked several times in one season. At least three  successive annual defoliations must occur to kill longleaf pine  seedlings. The best control in longleaf plantations is obtained by  controlled winter burning until seedlings are above 18 inches high (the  brown spot danger level). In nurseries and on valuable specimen trees  apply fungicidal sprays at two week intervals, during humid weather,  from April 15 through May."
,Pine,Cotton Root Rot," (fungus – ,):  Pines grown in alkaline soils are susceptible. Has primarily been a  problem on Afghan pine, a species adapted to dry, alkaline soils. (See  section on ,)"
,Pine,Fusiform Rust," (fungus – ,): A fungus  disease with alternate reproductive stages on pine and oak. Symptoms on  pine are spherical, oblong or linear swellings or galls on branches or  trunks (,).  Swellings on trunks may develop into open cankers. Galls rupture in  early spring releasing masses of orange spores that infect developing  oak leaves (,).  Remove galls on specimen trees by pruning. Remove infected trees in  planted forests during thinning operations. In nurseries, begin  fungicide sprays when oak trees in the area start to leaf out and  continue through June. Slash Pine is highly susceptible; longleaf and  certain selections of loblolly are moderately resistant."
,Pine,Needlecast," (fungi – , sp., ,, , sp. and others): Needles may develop dead spots with yellow borders. Eventually needles turn brown and shed (,).  Reproductive structures of the invading fungus can often be seen on  dead needles. On native pines in East Texas, needlecast is most evident  in late spring to early summer when needles shed. When severe, trees  have a scorched appearance. Needlecast is not considered a serious  disease and no chemical control is advised except on seedlings and  highly valued nursery stock or Christmas trees such as Virginia pine."
,Pine,Needle Curl, (physiological): Ends of needles curl in an abnormal manner. The cause is attributed to water stress.
,Pine,Needle Rust," (fungus – ,):  Present in Texas on loblolly and slash pine. The alternate stage is on  various composites, particularly aster and goldenrod. Symptoms on pine  are small fragile white “blister-like” structures that erupt through the  needle surface. These structures break to release thousands of small  pinkish to orange spores. Damage is seldom severe enough to warrant any  form of control."
,Pine,Pitch Canker:," (fungus – ,) Cankers usually develop on the main trunk but can occur on lateral branches (,).  Copious resin flows from trunk cankers and wood beneath cankers is  resin soaked. Resistance and good management practices limit pitch  canker development. High nitrogen predisposes pines to infection.  Virginia pine, grown for Christmas trees, is more susceptible than most  pines."
,Pine,Seedling Blight or Damping-Off," (fungi – , sp., , sp., , sp., , sp., and , sp.): These fungi usually live on dead organic matter in the soil but  they can become virulent parasites of living plants. They attack young  seedlings at, above, or below the soil line. Several things can be done  to control damping-off. Locate nurseries on light sandy soils, because  damping-off fungi flourish in heavier, wetter soils. Raise seed beds so  they will quickly drain after a rain. Mix oak or pine leaf mulch into  the seed beds to about two percent of soil volume. Mulch the seed beds  with pine needles. Fumigate soil prior to planting with methyl bromide  or other approved soil fumigant. Treat the seeds with a seed protectant  fungicide."
,Pine,Sphaeropsis Blight," (fungus – ,):  Was called Diplodia blight until name was changed in 1980. Presently,  Sphaeropis blight only is considered significant on Afghan pine grown  for Christmas trees in the western part of Texas. Infection takes place  in spring under wet conditions. Causes severe shoot dieback (,). Chemical control has not been highly effective."
,Pine,Wood Rots (fungi):," Discoloration, softening, crumbling and  disintegration of wood may be caused by a variety of fungi. Prevent  damage from fire, insects, machinery and unfavorable environmental  situations. Remove diseased trees. Plant trees adapted to the locality.  Avoid introducing foreign species of trees unless inspected and approved  by forestry personnel."

,Palm,Graphiola Leaf Spot (syn. False Smut),"Small, yellow to brown or black, wart-like spots develop on both sides of the leaf surface. As the fungus matures yellow filaments protrude from the middle of the raised spots."
,Palm,Cold Injury,"Loss of the outer trunk, browning of the leaves, bud rots and micro-nutrient deficiencies ,have been attributed to cold injury."
,Palm,Lethal Yellowing Disease (LYD),"In the Rio Grande Valley, the Canary Island date palm (,) and the true date palm (,) are affected, although other species of palms found in other areas are also susceptible.* The disease is first noticed when lower leaves turn yellow, then brown and droop. The wilt spreads to upper leaves and as the dead leaves collapse they form a “skirt” around the trunk. Eventually, all the leaves drop to the ground and only the trunk remains. Species adapted to Texas that are resistant include: Mexican fan palm (,), California fan palm (,), pygmy date palm (,), Texas palm (,), and Queen palm (,)."
,Palm,Leaf spots,"Size and shape of leaf spots vary due to the different fungal pathogens listed above. Spots can appear in a variety of colors: black, brown, yellow, or red and sometimes they appear water-soaked. As the disease progresses a halo will form around the leaf spot. The halo is usually a different color than the leaf spot itself. Leaf spots occur on leaves of all ages, especially juveniles. This disease maybe confused with potassium deficiency."
,Palm,Rachis Blight,Brown to reddish-brown streaks (lesions) form longitudinally along the rachis and petiole of the oldest leaves. The disease will eventually migrate to the younger leaves. The lesions disrupt the water-conducting tissue of the leaves and leaflets will die. Discoloration inside the rachis can be observed. Fungal structures may be present within the brown to reddish-brown streaks.
,Palm,Date Palm Lethal Decline (syn. Texas Phoenix Palm Decline),"Affected palms will drop all or most of its fruit. Then the oldest leaves will turn red to reddish-brown, beginning at the leaf tip and progressing to the leaf base. On Phoenix palms, the death of the first set of oldest leaves is succeeded shortly afterward by death of the central spear leaf. This is the most indicative symptom associated with this disease. The remaining leaves will continue to die progressively from the older leaves to the younger leaves. Complete death of the tree typically occurs within a few months from the time the first symptoms are observed.  "

,Oak,,"Brown, irregular spots form on the leaves. These spots tend to follow the leaf veins and midrib causing only a portion of the leaf to turn brown. After drying, the spots will have a papery texture. Late in the growing season the fungus can be seen as dark pustules on the veins and midribs of infected leaves and dead twigs."
,Oak,Oak Leaf Blisters,"Occurs on species in both the red oak and white oak groups. The fungus causes leaf cells to divide abnormally and enlarge. If you flip the leaf over you will observe light-green cup-like depressions. Yellow, blister-like bulges, corresponding with the lower leaf depressions, will be seen on the upper leaf surface. As the disease progresses, blisters coalesce and will cause the leaf to curl. The fungus can sometimes be seen in the depressions, first colorless then darkens after spores are released."
,Oak,Tubakia (Actinopelte) Leaf Spot,"This disease is most severe on members of the red oak group, but white oaks are also susceptible. Small, round spots form on the leaves. These spots are usually reddish-brown and tend to have a yellow halo around them. If the infection is severe, defoliation may occur."
,Oak,Spot Anthracnose,"Tiny sunken blackish-brown spots will form on the upper surface of the leaf. Symptoms are first visible in early June and increase in number until the middle of August. By that time foliage is severely damaged and the tree is a pale yellow. When infection is severe, defoliation occurs."
,Oak,Powdery Mildew,"Powdery mildew occurs on all groups of oaks. Infected leaves have a faint indistinct spot on the upper leaf surface and a white to off-white powdery growth on the lower surface. The fungus will most often be found along the veins and midribs of the leaf. In severe cases, infected leaves will be slightly disfigured."
,Oak,Southern Cone Rust," infects pines in mid-winter. The telial stage is only produced on evergreen oaks, which are closely associated with live oaks. Yellow to orange pustules can be observed on the lower leaf surface of infected oak leaves. "
,Oak,Hypoxylon Canker,"Hypoxylon canker occurs primarily on trees which are or have been in stressed conditions. The fungus invades the tree through injured surfaces on its limbs and trunk. The disease is first evident as a dieback of one or more branches. The foliage of the diseased limbs turns yellow and dries. This dieback continues from branch to branch until the tree dies. The fungus infects the inner bark causing the outer bark to slough off. This exposes large masses of brown, dusty spores which disseminate. Left behind is a grayish surface covered with many black fruiting bodies. The fungus causes black to brown discoloration in the sapwood which can be observed in a cross-section of the wood."
,Oak,Twig Blight,The fungus enters the tree through wounded twigs. Brown streaks can be observed in the sapwood of infected twigs and branches. Bark lesions that resemble pimple-like swellings will also develop. Infected twigs and branches die and the attached leaves will turn brown. Affected trees will look like they have been attacked by cicada.
,Oak,Endothia Canker,Post oaks and red oaks are particularly susceptible. It has been associated with pruning cuts or limb breakage. Removal of cankers by pruning and increased tree vigor helps reduce losses.
,Oak,Canker Rots,
,Oak,Burls,"Burls can occur on both oaks and hickories. The fungus causes large tumor-like swellings on the branches and trunk of the tree. There are some swellings which occur on white oaks that aren’t caused by a fungus, but rather by the wood naturally growing over young buds and forming burl-like swellings.,
"
,Oak,Oak Wilt,"This is an important disease of all oaks. Members of the white oak group die very slowly after infection occurs and can carry the fungus in the vascular system without showing any symptoms. Red oaks die rapidly after infection occurs. Symptoms show up on red oaks in early May as a bronzing of the leaves. On live oak, the leaf symptoms are variable. The most common symptom is brown necrosis of the leaf veins. The remainder of the leaf may remain green or turn slightly yellow. Severe leaf drop occurs while the leaves are still green. Cuts made through the wood may show discoloration in the last annual ring. Symptom development usually begins on one limb or branch and in time spreads rapidly to the remainder of the tree. ,The fungus may be carried from tree to tree by various insects and through root grafts. Sap feeding beetles are important in the short range spread. Red oaks which wilt in the late summer or early fall develop spore mats under their bark during the next spring. As the mats develop, the bark sloughs off or ruptures exposing the fungus. Insects are attracted to the mats. If the insects move from mats to healthy trees which have open wounds the fungus can then enter the healthy tree and move into the water conducting tissue."
,Oak,Oak Decline,"Trees affected by the fungus first show signs of thinning out and twig dieback in their upper canopy. The dieback will generally increase each year. As dieback reaches the larger limbs, which comprise the main canopy, sucker growth becomes evident on the main scaffold limbs. As the disease continues to progress, only the main scaffold limbs remain alive, however, they will eventually die. This may take from five to ten years on live oaks, but less on other oaks after the first visual symptoms are observed. Live oak, post oak, water oak, Texas red oak, willow oak, sycamore, persimmon, winged elm, hackberry, American elm and western soapberry are reported to be hosts for Oak Decline."
,Mulberry, spp.,
,Mulberry,Bacterial Blight," (bacterium – ,):  Watersoaked spots appear on leaves and shoots have black stripes. The  leaves at the twig tips wilt and dry up. Some control is obtainable on  young trees by pruning dead shoots in autumn and spraying with approved  fungicides."
,Mulberry,Leaf Spots," (fungi – ,, ,, and , spp.): The leaves of mulberry are spotted by these fungi in very rainy seasons. The , fungus can cause defoliation of older trees. Valuable specimens should  be sprayed with approved fungicide if leaf spots are serious."
,Mulberry,Popcorn Disease," (fungus – ,):  This disease, known only in the southern states, is largely confined to  the carpels of the fruit. It causes them to swell and remain greenish,  and interferes with ripening. The disease is of little importance. It  does not lessen the value of the tree as an ornamental."
,Mulberry,False Mildew," (fungus – ,):  The foliage of mulberries growing in the southern states may suffer  severely from attacks of this fungus. It appears in July as whitish,  indefinite patches on the undersides of the leaves. Yellowish spores  emerge from the stomata on the underside and spread out so as to form a  white, cobweb-like coating; the general appearance is that of a powdery  mildew. The asexual spores are colorless, each composed of several  cells. The infected leaves fall to the ground, and the overwintering or  ascocarpic stage matures in spring on these leaves. Gather and burn all  fallen leaves in autumn. Spray with approved fungicide mixture as soon  as the mold appears in July."
,Mulberry,Cankers:," Cankers on twigs and branches and die back of twigs may be caused by at least six fungi: , sp., , sp., , , sp., and , sp. These can be distinguished only by microscopic or laboratory tests.  Prune and burn dead branches. Keep trees in good vigor by watering and  fertilizing."
,Mulberry,Powdery Mildews," (fungi – , and ,):  The lower leaf surface is covered by a white, powdery coating of these  fungi. Valuable specimens can be protected by occasionally spraying with  approved fungicide."
,Mulberry,Mushroom Root Rot," (fungus – ,):  Attacks in its usual manner with hardwoods, in that while its  rhizomorphs may occur generally on healthy root bark, pathogenic  invasion and damage by , is almost always preceded by major root injury or other debilitation of the host."
,Mulberry,Cotton Root Rot," (fungus – ,):  White mulberry has been rated highly susceptible to cotton root rot.  The Russian mulberry was tested for planting as a shelterbelt tree in  the root rot prone areas of Texas and Oklahoma. Based on six years of  records it was considered “intermediate in susceptibility, possibly  usable on sandy sites.”"
,Mulberry,Root Knot Nematodes," (, sp.): These nematodes attack seedlings in the East and Southwest. The  problem can be serious on young trees but has less effect on older  trees."
,Mulberry,Summer Scorch, (physiological): Leaves on affected  trees have chlorotic margins. This condition is thought to be caused by  low soil moisture and high atmospheric temperatures.
,Mimosa,,
,Mimosa,Mimosa or Fusarium Wilt," (fungus – ,):  The leaves wilt, dry and shrivel, although they may remain green or  yellowish for some time. Later the leaves fall and the branch dies.  Sometimes only one side of a tree may be affected the first year of  onset of symptoms. Suckers may sprout from the main trunk, but there is  usually no recovery. Brown discoloration can be found in the sapwood of  trunks and branches even before the leaves wilt. Discolored areas of cut  stems may appear as complete rings. Dark rings are also present in the  roots. Infection is through the roots. The fungus can be carried over in  seed from diseased trees. Two wilt-resistant varieties are available –  Charlotte, with light-colored flowers, and Tryon, with deeper red  flowers."
,Mimosa,Leaf Spot," (fungus – ,): The  only described leaf disease of mimosa in this country. Angular, small,  dark brown spot develops as disease progresses, the center of the spot  may become pale. Disease generally not serious enough to warrant  treatment."
,Mimosa,Cotton Root Rot:," (See section on ,)"
,Mimosa,Root Knot Nematodes:," (See section on ,)"
,Mesquite, spp.,
,Mesquite,Powdery Mildew," (fungus – ,):  Infected leaves are covered with a white powdery material. When disease  is severe, infected leaves can be distorted. Benomyl can be used for  the control of this organism, however, control is not generally  necessary."
,Mesquite,Spongy Yellow Heart Rot," (fungus – ,):  The fungus enters through broken limbs or through insect tunneling. In  advance stages the interior of the tree will be a soft, spongy yellow or  brown mass. Perennial cankers are bracket to hoof shaped. The upper  surface of the fungus is dark brown to black while the underneath is a  dull reddish brown. Control is not recommended."
,Mesquite,Rust," (fungi – , and ,):  Rust attacks the leaves causing a distortion of the leaf mid vein. It  is most often observed on the first leaves in the spring. Damage is  usually not significant and control is not required."
,Mesquite,Leaf Spot," (fungus – ,):  Although the fungicide benomyl would control the leafspot, its use is  generally not necessary due to the limited damage caused by the fungus."
,Mesquite,Crown Gall," (bacterium – ,): (See section on ,)"
,Mesquite,Cotton Root Rot," (fungus – ,): (See section on ,)"
,Maple, spp.,
,Maple,Anthracnose," (fungus – ,):  In rainy seasons this disease may be serious on silver maples and  Japanese maples. Irregular, light to reddish-brown, or purplish-brown,  dead areas occur on the leaves. Many spots occur along the veins. Areas  often enlarge killing the entire leaf. Leaves partially killed appear as  if scorched. Many infected leaves drop in late spring. Twigs may die  back. Collect and destroy fallen leaves. Spraying with a recommended  fungicide when buds begin to unfold in the spring and again in 10 to 20  days will help prevent infection."
,Maple,Leaf Scorch," (physiological): Light or dark brown areas along the leaf margins  extending toward the mid vein. Foliage appears bronzed, dried and  scorched. Causes: late spring frost; hot, drying summer winds; and  drought. Water trees during summer droughts. Plant in areas protected  from drying winter and summer winds."
,Maple,Wilt," (fungus – ,);  Sudden wilting and drying of leaves on individual branches,  particularly on one side of the tree. New leaves may be reduced in size  and turn yellow. Infected trees may die slowly or suddenly. An  olive-green discoloration may develop in the sapwood. Other fungi can  also cause this discoloration. The disease does not spread rapidly from  tree to tree. Infection takes place most commonly through the roots  because the fungus lives in soil. Some infections take place above  ground through wounds caused by insects or by pruning. Trees showing  general wilting of the entire tree cannot be saved. Recently infected  trees with only a few wilted branches may possibly be saved by adequate  fertilization and watering. It is thought that leaf growth is  stimulated, in turn enabling the rapid formation of a thick layer of  sapwood, which seals in the infected parts of the trees."
,Maple,Crown Gall," (bacterium – ,): Rough, irregular, swollen galls at the base of the trunk or on the roots. (See section on ,)"
,Maple,Ganoderma Rot," (fungus – ,): Rapid  decline and death of tree. Large, reddish, and varnish-like mushrooms  form at the base of the infected tree. No control known for this type  disease."
,Maple,Powdery Mildew," (fungus – ,): White fungus growth on leaves. Rarely serious enough to use control measures."
,Maple,Cotton Root Rot," (fungus – ,): Silver maple is rated as highly susceptible to ,)."
,Maple,Mushroom Root Rot," (fungus – ,): (See section on ,)"
,Maple,Trunk Rot," (fungus – , sp., , sp., and , sp.): Refer to section on , and shade trees."
,Magnolia, spp.,
,Magnolia,Leaf Spots," (fungi – , sp., , sp., , sp., , sp., and , sp.): Various sized leaf spots generally developing in late fall and early spring. Generally cause little damage."
,Magnolia,Algal Leaf Spot," (alga – ,):  Forms a velvety coating with reddish-brown hair-like structures on the  underside of the leaves. Occurs mainly in the Gulf Coast area. Causes  little damage but treatment with fungicides may be required in some  cases."
,Magnolia,Leaf-Shedding,: Magnolia will begin dropping leaves  in November and continue until early spring. This is a natural  phenomenon and the degree of leaf drop will depend upon genetic as well  as physiological factors affecting the tree. Some trees may be  completely denuded before new foliage comes out.
,Magnolia,Wood Rots," (fungi – , sp., , sp., ,):  Rot of heart wood. Colors range from white to black, may also be green  or red or brown. Lines of infection are conspicuous. Conks may be formed  on main trunk near soil line. Avoid wound. Infected portions may be  removed by tree surgery."
,Magnolia,Cotton Root Rot:," (See section on ,)"
,Magnolia,Root Knot Nematodes:," (See section on ,)"
,Magnolia,Chlorosis:, (See section on Chlorosis)
,Magnolia,Winter Injury:," Some trees that harden off gradually in the fall can take temperatures as low as 0,F and show no damage. Other individuals are hurt easily if temperatures commonly get below 15,F.  Killing of leaves and shoots can be extensive. Winter drought coupled  with low temperatures can cause extensive die back or death."
,Elm,spp.,
,Elm,Black Leaf Spot," (fungus – ,):  Small, yellow spots appear first on upper surface of leaves, then  gradually develop a shiny black appearance. Heavy spotting causes leaf  yellowing and early defoliation in wet seasons. Usually defoliation does  not occur much before normal leaf fall so control is not warranted. If  trees have been affected seriously in previous seasons, fungicidal  sprays applied when leaves are unfolding, when they reach full size, and  again two weeks later will help prevent serious defoliation. Raking and  burning fallen leaves will reduce inoculum for future infection."
,Elm,Other Leaf Spots," (fungi – , sp., , sp., , sp., and others): Dark, elongated spots develop on midribs, veins and  margins of leaves, or spots of various shapes and colors may develop on  any portion of leaf surface. Destroy fallen leaves and control as for  black spot."
,Elm,Wet wood or Slime Flux," (bacterium – ,):  Chronic bleeding of sap from crotches, wound or other weakened areas of  trunk, with unsightly discoloration of bark in affected area. Sap  frequently is sour smelling. Bleeding or fluxing is most pronounced  during spring months or during wet weather. The problem results from  fermentation processes of the causal bacteria creating pressures up to  60 pounds per square inch within the tree. Tapping directly into the  trunk just below the affected area to provide an outlet for abnormal sap  and gasses will relieve internal pressure and may aid in recovery.  Drill a small hole (one-half inch diameter or less) directly below the  bleeding site and slightly upward into the center of the trunk. Install a  tight fitting drainpipe in the drilled hole making sure the end of pipe  extends far enough outward so that sap does not fall on the tree."
,Elm,Dutch Elm Disease," (fungus – ,):  Symptoms may appear on one or more branches on any part of the tree in  contrast to phloem necrosis where tops of infected trees show first  abnormalities. Leaves on individual branches wilt and turn yellow; in  some instances leaves wilt very rapidly, dry out, then fall while still  green. Twig terminals of affected branches sometimes become curved to  resemble a shepherd’s crook. As a further diagnostic aid, twigs when cut  across, show discoloration or browning of water-conducting tissues in  the sapwood. Tree defoliation may occur rapidly or take place over an  entire season. Likewise infected trees may die in a single season or  live for several years. The disease is spread by elm bark beetles  infested with the causal fungus. Development of this disease has been  limited in Texas."

,Cottonwood and Poplar, spp.,
,Cottonwood and Poplar,Cytospora Canker," (fungus – ,):  Primarily affects weak trees and occurs mainly on stems. Cankers first  appear as slightly sunken areas on the smooth bark of branches and  trunks. Cankers generally develop in an elliptical pattern and enlarge  until stems are girdled and killed. Diseased part becomes discolored and  sapwood is reddish-brown and watersoaked. During moist weather, reddish  threads of fungus spores ooze from pimple-like fruiting bodies on  cankered areas. Infected limbs should be removed, as the fungus moves  down the stem and invades larger branches or even the trunk. Tree  surgery to remove cankers in the main trunk may prolong the life of the  tree. Sterilize pruning tools. Avoid wounding trees. Simon and Lombardy  varieties are extremely susceptible – Rio Grande is resistant."
,Cottonwood and Poplar,Dothichiza or Branch Canker," (fungus – ,):  This disease mainly attacks young planted and nursery trees. Dark,  sunken, cracked cankers form on twigs, trunks and branches. Callus  tissue may form in old cankers. Sapwood is discolored. Wounds are  primary source of entry for the fungus and should be avoided. Lombardy  is by far the most susceptible species. No effective control measures  are known. Pruning of diseased parts does not help control this disease,  in fact, it spreads it."
,Cottonwood and Poplar,Septoria Canker," (fungus – , or ,):  Cottonwood and Lombardy varieties are susceptible. Leaf infection  precedes twig or stem infection. Canker is not easily distinguished from  , canker. The canker on highly susceptible young stems  appears sunken, with smooth bark and raised, irregularly concentric  rings of unbroken bark. Some cankers are flat, others are swollen at the  margins. Identification usually depends on finding little black  fruiting structures (pycnidia). Remove infected limbs. Avoid wounding  trees and sterilize pruning tools. Preventative fungicide sprays may  control the leafspot stage."
,Cottonwood and Poplar,Powdery Mildew," (fungus – ,):  A white fungus grows on both sides of the leaves. Damage is usually not  serious enough to warrant control measures, but fungicides can be used  on valuable trees."
,Cottonwood and Poplar,Heart Rot," (fungus – , spp.): Primarily a disease of  heartwood. Discoloration and soft rot of heartwood. Distinguishing  feature is the shelf-like fruiting structures or conks formed on the  main trunk. Trees with conks may live for several years.

,Ash, spp.,
,Ash,Anthracnose," (fungus – , sp.): Large areas of the leaf, especially along the edges and veins, turn brown. Premature defoliation will follow severe anthracnose infection during wet seasons. The disease may be confused with problems caused by weather adversities or other physiological problems. Spraying with a fungicide two or three times at 14 day intervals during humid periods will control the disease."
,Ash,Leaf Spots," (fungi – , sp., , sp.): Among the most common foliage diseases of ash that occur virtually wherever ash is grown. Lesions appear early, hundreds may develop on a single leaflet. They are very small at first. Spray as recommended for anthracnose to control the disease.,
(fungi – , sp.): Another common leaf spot of ash appears toward the end of summer. Groups of small dark fruiting structures form in spots on the bottom of the leaf, while the upper side may show only a slight spotty discoloration. By the time the spots on the top turn brown, defoliation has begun. Spray as recommended for anthracnose to control the disease.,
(fungi – ,): Spots are irregular to almost circular, three to seven mm in width. The long, thin, many-celled spores are produced on black stromata within the dull gray-brown spots. Spray as recommended for anthracnose."
,Ash,Rust," (fungus – ,): Swollen and distorted gall-like structures occur on leaves and twigs. The orange swellings are more common early in the growing season, particularly in the Gulf Coast area. Two stages of the rust fungus are known: one which occurs on ash trees, the other on grasses, Spartina sp. Spraying with fungicides at two to three week intervals during early spring will control the disease."
,Ash,Cotton Root Rot," (fungus – ,): Ash is moderately susceptible to the cotton root rot fungus, particularly during the younger stages of growth. (See section on ,)"
,Ash,Wood Rots," (fungi – , sp., , sp., , sp., etc.): Most of these fungi attack only weakened or wounded trees. Infection usually takes place through wounds caused by lawn mowers, pruning, or strong winds. Trees decline slowly for no apparent reason and the fungus slowly rots the wood. After the disease has progressed for some time, leathery, hard structures (conks) can be seen attached to the lower parts of the trunk. These are fruiting bodies of the fungus appearing as bracket growth during certain times of the year. Control is accomplished by avoiding mechanical wounds, treating exposed wounds with pruning paint, fertilizing trees as needed and protecting from insects."

,English Ivy,,
,English Ivy,Root and Stem Rot," (fungus – ,):  The fungus may attack roots, stems and lower leaves. symptoms on lower  leaves first appear on those leaves in contact with the soil. Affected  leaves are characterized by well-defined water-soaked areas which  enlarge rapidly during cool, moist conditions. At first, leaves are dark  green, they then wilt and turn dark-brown. Stems and roots may also be  attacked. Infected areas are at first water-soaked in appearance and  later become sunken and reddish-brown. Best control is obtained by  planting only in sterilized beds. Beds should be well-drained. Soil  fungicides applied as a drench around infected plants may be effective."
,English Ivy,Root Rot," (fungus – ,): Affected plants wilt and die suddenly. Leaves of infected plants turn brown and remain on the plant. (See section on ,)"
,English Ivy,Anthracnose," (fungus – ,):  A common disease of English ivy. Infected leaves have large tan-to-dark  brown spots with a darker border. The center of infected areas may have  small black spots formed by pycnidia (fruiting bodies of the fungus).  Spots range in size from one-eighth inch to one-half inch in diameter.  As the spots age, the centers may dry up and fall out giving a shredded  or shot hole appearance. The fungus may also infect stems causing dark,  sunken lesions. In some instances, the stem may be completely girdled  causing death of the distal portion. Infected leaves should be picked  off and destroyed. Avoid overhead watering. Foliar fungicide application  at regular intervals are effective."
,English Ivy,Bacterial Leaf Spot," (bacteria – , spp.): Circular spots which are, at first, light green water-soaked  areas. As the spots enlarge, they become brown-to-dark brown with red  margins. Eventually, the center of the spots dry and crack. Young twigs  and petioles are also attacked. Infection on stems and petioles causes a  blackening and shriveling of the tissue. Cankers form and may girdle  the stem. Tips of growing portions of the plant turn black and this  blackening may extend downward into the older wood. Infected plants may  fail to grow normally and have pale yellow-green foliage. Remove and  destroy all infected plant tissue. Avoid overhead watering, overwatering  and high temperatures, if possible."
,English Ivy,Leaf Spots," (fungi – ,, , spp., G,, ,):  Brown lesions will occur on the leaves and may also infect the stem,  causing girdling, collapse and death of apical portion. Infected leaves  can be picked off and burned. Remaining foliage should be sprayed with a  fungicide."
,English Ivy,Sooty Mold," (fungus, , sp., and  others): The sooty mold fungus may develop on English ivy growing  beneath certain trees. This mold lives on secretions of aphids and scale  insects which fall from the tree above. This mold seldom causes damage.  Control insects to prevent this problem."
,Dichondra, spp.,
,Dichondra,Root Rot," (fungus – , spp.): Poor drainage and winter cold may cause Alternaria root rot."
,Dichondra,Rust," (fungus –,): This rust, under humid conditions, may develop rapidly."
,Creeping Euonymus,,
,Creeping Euonymus,Anthracnose," (fungus – , spp.): Brown lesions on the leaves, in which tiny fungus fruiting  bodies may be seen with a hand lens. Apply dithiocarbamate or copper  fungicides."
,Creeping Euonymus,Crown Gall," (bacterial – ,):  Both the stems and roots may have good size galls. Destroy heavily  infected plants. Plants will lack vigor and may die back. If only a few  galls, prune out and destroy. Sterilize pruner with 70% alcohol or 10%  household bleach."
,Creeping Euonymus,Powdery Mildew," (fungus – , spp.): White powdery mold or gray “felt” patches on leaves. Leaves may  yellow, curl, and drop early. Prune to thin out shrub. Use preventive  fungicide sprays."

,Ajuga,,
,Ajuga,Root Knot Nematode," (nematode – ,):  Ajuga is very susceptible to Root Knot Nematodes. Infected plantings  will begin to thin-out in spots and plants may die. Roots of infected  plants will contain small knots caused by nematode feeding. (See section  on ,)"
,Ajuga,Southern Blight," (fungus – ,):  Southern Blight, also called Crown Rot, is a soil-borne disease of  ajuga that will be more serious in poorly drained soils. Plants suddenly  turn yellow and die in patches during warm, humid weather. Bases of  stems rot and turn brown or black. Frequently, a white mold develops in  which small reddish-tan bodies (sclerotia) develop. These sclerotia  survive the winter and other unfavorable conditions. (See section on ,)"
,Bermudagrass,Anthracnose," (fungus –,): This disease is more likely to occur in Southeast Texas during August on coastal Bermudagrass. Symptoms that occur during cool, wet weather differ from those that occur during warm, dry weather. During cool, wet periods, a basal stem rot may occur. During warm weather, especially the soil is dry and the bermudagrass canopy and atmosphere are wet or very humid, the pathogen readily colonizes older leaves and hastens leaf and tiller senescence. Sometimes, the pathogen causes oblong, reddish-brown leaf lesions. Tiny black fungal structures with erect, minute black spines can often be seen with a hand lens on infected dead leaf and stem tissue."
,Bermudagrass,Rust," (fungus – ,): Rust is an occasional problem that usually results in little damage. Occasionally, minor diseases become severe when certain factors are right for disease development. When rust occurs on forage bermudagrass, it should be immediately cut for hay or grazed heavily. This will remove the heavy canopy that favors the retention of high humidity. There is no evidence that these rust fungi produce toxins that would be damaging to livestock."
,Bermudagrass,Fading out," (fungus – , and other fungi): ,, formerly in the genus ,, causes a leaf spot and crown, stolon, and root rot. Leaf spots are irregularly shaped and brown to black. Severely infected leaves may appear tan to straw-colored. This condition is most likely to occur when the grass is in a weakened condition due to certain growth requirements not being met. This occurs commonly in coastal Bermudagrass when potassium levels are low in the soil. This is a common problem in the deep, sandy soils of East Texas. To avoid this problem, growers should fertilize properly with a complete fertilizer, avoid overgrazing or ill timed cutting, and prevent the development of thatch at the base of the plant."
,Bermudagrass,Smut," (fungus – ,): Smut occasionally occurs on common Bermudagrass but is not known to reduce forage production appreciably. It becomes apparent only when plants form seed heads that are colonized by the smut fungus. Control is not required.  "
,Bermudagrass,Nematodes," (nematode – , spp. and other): Common Bermudagrass is considered to be more susceptible to nematode damage than coastal and other improved forage types. If nematode damage limits growth of common Bermudagrass, one should sod with an improved forage type, preferably Coastal. Nematode problems are more likely in sandy loam soils than in soils with high clay content."
,Alfalfa and Sweet Clover,Alfalfa Stem Nematode," (nematode – ,): The stem nematode has caused reduced yield in only a few Texas fields. Symptoms include shortened stems which become thickened and club-like. Crown buds infested with nematodes become swollen and distorted and will break off easily. The stem nematode is active only under cool, moist conditions. Plants grow normally during warm weather. Nematodes are introduced into fields by planting poor quality, nematode infected seed and by allowing run off water from infested fields to drain into other fields. A rotation with sorghum or small grains is also beneficial."
,Alfalfa and Sweet Clover,Dodder," (parasitic plant – ,): This yellowish parasitic plant that has no leaves twists around the stems of host plants. Suckers or haustoria of dodder penetrate the host tissue and withdraw nutrients for their own use. It usually occurs in spots in the field. Seed produced by dodder are similar in size and color to those of alfalfa. This is how the plant usually becomes distributed from one area of the county to another. Seed fields should be screened carefully for occurrence of this parasitic plant and infested areas should be burned prior to harvest."
,Alfalfa and Sweet Clover,Mosaic ,"(virus): Alfalfa mosaic is a widespread virus disease carried by insects, but it has never reached epidemic proportions. Light and dark streaks and blotches in the leaves are the main symptoms. Some stunting may occur. No special control is practiced in alfalfa."
,Alfalfa and Sweet Clover,"Rust, Leaf Spots, and Stem Blight",": Several species of fungi often cause leaf and stem spots on alfalfa but are not considered to be serious problems. Small, brown to black circular spots on the lower leaves are the most noticeable symptom. Some of the lower leaves may turn yellow and drop. The disease can develop rapidly when moist conditions exist."
,Alfalfa and Sweet Clover,Wilt Disease ,"(bacterium – ,): Water conducting tissues in stem, crown, and roots appear brown to black. Plants are yellow and dwarfed. Stems are more numerous with bacterial wilt. Plants die after several months. The bacteria enters the plant roots and may live in the soil many years. Apply potash according to soil tests. Use crops other than legumes in the rotation for three to four years."
,Alfalfa and Sweet Clover,Cotton Root Rot," (fungus – ,): This disease occurs in heavy alkaline soil but is not a problem in the High Plains, Panhandle areas, or the Brazos River bottom. Areas of dead plants occur in fields, usually in a circular pattern. Brownish, fuzzy strands of the fungus often appear on affected roots (See Illustration). The bark is dead and rotted on the tap root. When affected plants are pulled, they usually break off easily at or near the soil surface. It occurs in warm weather following rain or irrigation."
,Alfalfa and Sweet Clover,Downy Mildew," (fungus – ,): This disease is often seen in the spring when cool, moist weather exists. It may cause serious reductions in yield. The fungus, which causes new growth to turn yellow and new leaves to be twisted, infects that plant systemically for life and can remain in soil on old plants for several years. A white moldy growth is usually present on the underside of diseased leaves. Where severe, cut early to save as many leaves as possible. Prevention is possible by using clean, certified, and treated seed to establish new stands. Practice long rotations when the fungus is present."
,Alfalfa and Sweet Clover,Root and Crown Rot Complex," (fungi and bacteria – , spp. , spp., , spp., and others): This complex is one of our most troublesome alfalfa and clover problems. Stand decline is the most noticeable symptom (Note Illustration). Decline usually begins during the second year after planting and gradually becomes more severe. Early symptoms include yellowing and wilting of stem tips or entire shoots which eventually die. Plants are normally stunted and have an increased number of small, shortened stems and small leaves. Roots may be rotten or simply have a few discolored lesions. Reddish-brown streaks are usually evident when the outer bark is removed. Rotting may occur only at the crown area of the plant. Control is difficult. Use of tolerant alfalfa varieties is often the best method of control. Do not allow water to stand in a field for extended periods."
,Alfalfa and Sweet Clover,Seed Rot and Seedling Disease,": Several soil fungi may attack seed as it germinates or may attack the young seedling after it has emerged from the ground. If the seedlings have emerged, the disease is characterized by a soft, water soaked area on the stem just below the soil line. Severe stand reduction can occur. This problem is most common when the soil is excessively wet. Chemical seed treatment may help reduce stand losses."

,Guar,Other diseases:," Fusarium wilt, the cotton root rot fungus, curly top virus, and root knot nematodes attack guar plants."
,Kenaf,Leaf Deformation," (geminivirus): This disease is transmitted by whiteflies. The leaves are crinkled, misshapen and may have diffuse yellow areas. Both compound and simple leaves are affected. Infection has been seen only late in the growing season and there has been no detectable effect on yield."
,Kenaf,Leafspot," (several species of fungi): , and , produce round, reddish brown lesions with tan centers, while , produces water-soaked or sunken lesions and causes some leaf chlorosis."
,Kenaf,Powdery Mildew," (fungus – ,): The symptoms are an extensive growth of white, powdery fungal mycelium on the upper leaf surface, followed by leaf defoliation and abortion of floral structures and early-stage seed pods. Tiny, dark spherical cleistothecia (fruiting structures) are produced on senescent leaves. This disease can diminish seed yield and reduce seed quality in susceptible varieties."
,Grasses (Forage),Seed Rot and Seedling Blight," (fungi – , spp., ,, , sp., , sp., , spp.): Germinating seed of all grass varieties may be attacked and rotted. Small sprouts may be killed before or soon after they come through the soil by the same fungi that cause seed rot. Where the problem has been serious, treat seed. (See ,.) Avoid planting too deeply."
,Grasses (Forage),Root Rot and Crown Rot,"(fungi): Most fungi that cause seed rot and seedling blight are involved. Yellow to brown discolorations appear on affected root and crown tissue. The lower leaves may become yellow and die, and finally, nearly all infected plants either die or are retarded severely. Weakened plants are killed by short periods of drought or winter injury. Control is the same as for seed rod and seedling blight. Use good management practices."
,Grasses (Forage),Powdery Mildew," (fungus – ,): White to gray mold growth develops either in blotches or uniformly over the entire leaf surface. Dried out areas of dead leaf tissue may develop and kill the whole leaf. Severely infected plants may become weakened and die. In pastures where the grass is either closely grazed or cut, the symptoms are not as conspicuous. On ranges and pastures, control methods are impractical. For grass nurseries and grass crops for seed production, see Chemical Control section. Grasses most severely affected by powdery mildew are wheat grasses (,), bent-grass (,), fescue (,a), and bluegrass (,). Common rescuegrass is very susceptible. Other strains of rescuegrass seem more resistant. The disease is apt to be more severe during cool weather with frequent showers or following application of irrigation water."
,Grasses (Forage),Ergot," (fungus – ,spp.): Dark brown to nearly black, spurlike bodies (sclerotia) extend beyond the floral bracts in diseased florets. One to many ergot bodies may develop in a single head. When grass matures, most of the sclerotia drop to the ground. They be harvested with hay or seed or consumed by grazing livestock. Ergot in Dallisgrass is prevalent in Southeast Texas. Occasionally, it can be found on Bahiagrass. The disease affects production of grasses very little, but it does have serious consequences on livestock that feed on diseased grass. When ergot is consumed in quantities too small to manifest pronounced symptoms of ergotism, it affects the general health and vigor of the animals. When ergot is consumed in considerably larger quantities over a long period, ergot results in either spasmodic or gangrenous ergotism. In the latter phase of the disease, hoofs, tips of ears, and tips of tail may slough, teeth may drop out, and hair may shed excessively prior to death. There is no effective control on host plants. The following will help to avoid losses of livestock due to ergotism: Employ a crop rotation where none of the host plants follow each other. Do not plant ergot-infested seed. When ergot appears in pastures, either clip the heads or wait until the grass matures and the sclerotia have fallen to the ground before using it for grazing purposes. Mowing borders and fence rows before heading will help eliminate secondary infestation. The disease is sometimes worse in these areas. Do not harvest ergotized crops for hay. Removal of sclerotia from ergotized cereal or grain prior to feeding it, is essential to avoid the ergot disease of livestock. To make ergotized grains safe for feeding, the sclerotia should be removed by the brine sedimentation process. By this method, the ergotized grain should be placed in a vat of salt solution (4 pounds in 25 gallons of water). When the grain is stirred, the sclerotia rise to the surface and can be skimmed off. Destroy screenings and skimmings. Grain treated by this method should be dried before storing."
,Grasses (Forage),Leaf Rust," (fungus – ,spp.): See leaf rust of oats and wheat for description. Many different leaf rusts damage grasses."
,Grasses (Forage),Brown Leaf Blight," (fungus – ,): Apt to occur in Southeast Texas during August on coastal Bermudagrass. Grayish brown to dark brown streaks occur on leaf blades. No chemical control is recommended."
,Flax,,
,Flax,Pasmo," (fungus – ,): This is probably the most important disease of flax in Texas. Lesions develop first on the cotyledons and later on the lower leaves of the seedling. Lesions are usually circular and vary in color from greenish yellow to dark brown, depending upon age. Later, stem lesions develop, first as small elongated lesions which then enlarge and coalesce, extending around the stem as well as longitudinally. The infected areas alternate with green tissue until infection becomes severe; then the stems brown as the plants are defoliated. There is no evidence that the fungus oversummers in Texas, so it is likely that the disease is primarily seed-borne. Rotation and removal of straw or covering the straw with plowing helps reduce the inoculum. Use seed treatment and resistant varieties."
,Flax,Rust," (fungus – ,): This disease can be readily recognized by the reddish, raised spots on leaves and stems. Early in the season, the rounded bright orange pustules can be seen on leaves. Later, the pustules turn black, causing defoliation of plants. The disease is favored by cool, moist weather. It is spread by spores produced in the pustules. The rust organism overwinters in flax straw, from which spores are produced that cause primary infection. Susceptible varieties such as De Oro should not be grown in Texas. New races of the fungus develop; therefore, epidemics are likely to occur until new resistant varieties are developed."
,Flax,Aster Yellows,"(mycoplasma): The causal agent is transmitted from diseased to healthy plants by the six-spotted leafhopper. Infected plants are bright yellow with considerable distortion of foliage and floral parts. Flower parts turn green, forming a rosette-like growth instead of a boll. Seeds are shriveled or do not form. There is no effective control for this disease. Dense plantings tend to reduce the incidence of disease, since the insect vector prefers plants that are not crowded."
,Flax,Curly Top,"(virus): The vector of this disease is the beet leafhopper, an insect which prefers arid conditions; therefore, the disease is more prevalent during dry years. Infected plants show a characteristic erectness of leaves about the stem. Plants may be yellow or reddish in color and the lower leaves drop prematurely. Later, plants branch abnormally, sometimes with tops twisted. Plants affected by curly top are more susceptible to Rhizoctonia root rot. There is no effective control for this disease."
,Flax,Wilt," (fungus – ,): The fungus can attack flax plants at any stage of growth. In the seedling stage, roots are ashen-gray in color and the small plants wilt and die. In older plants, leaves turn yellow at the tip first, turning completely yellow later on. The disease is seed and soil-borne, and affects plants mostly when temperatures are high. Since flax in Texas is grown in the winter, the disease has not caused serious problems. Most common varieties are resistant."
,Flax,Boll Blight,"(fungi – various organisms): Several fungi are involved in the complex disease. The fungi invade the capsule, turning the pod black and causing discoloration and rotting of grain. The disease is enhanced by insect damage and humid, wet conditions. Some varieties are more resistant to the disease because of the structural shape of the pod, which deters the entrance of organisms."
,Flax,Other disorders:," Mineral deficiencies, particularly iron and zinc, occur commonly in Texas. Zinc deficient plants show death of the terminal bud, profuse tillering and necrosis of the leaves. Plants are small and unthrifty with reduced yields.,
Another condition, late season decline, results in the wilting of plants brought about by drought stress during the flowering stage."
,Castor,Seed Rot and Seedling Blights,"(fungi and bacteria – several genera): A great deal of damage occurs to cultivated castor in the seedling stage. Seed-borne diseases were once considered uncommon, but at least ten parasitic fungi have been isolated from castor seed. Many of these penetrate the testa making disinfection difficult. Many of these fungi attack irrigated plantings of castor at any stage of growth, though most damage is on young plants."
,Castor,,
,Castor,Charcoal Rot," (fungus – ,): This is a widespread and frequently serious disease of many crops. When intercropping and rotation are practiced, the disease becomes more damaging when all the crops are susceptible. Charcoal rot develops rapidly on crops under moisture stress after flowering and seedset. Temperatures between 77 and 95 degrees F favor rapid growth of the fungus. The disease causes blackening of the stem near the soil line, followed by premature death."
,Castor,Cotton Root Rot," (fungus – ,): Castor is very susceptible and should not be planted in soils where the fungus is established. Cultural practices as recommended for root rot control of cotton may be effective."
,Castor,Leaf Spot," (fungus – ,): Light brown, generally circular interveinal spots with margins of concentric rings, are produced. With age, the center of the spot changes to light gray."
,Castor,Leaf Spot," (fungus – ,): Light brown, generally circular spots appear on leaves that are larger than Cercospora, which tend to become angular with age. A gray-green spore mass may sometimes be seen."
,Castor,Bacterial Leaf Spot," (bacterium – ,): Numerous, irregular, small, brown watersoaked spots occur on leaves, followed by premature defoliation. Spots gradually turn black with dried sections of leaf tissue disintegrating and falling from leaves. Racemes are attacked under humid conditions. Serious losses may occur under humid conditions."
,Castor,Bacterial Leaf Rust," (bacteria – ,sp.): Leaves dry up, turn black and fall. Branches also turn black, and stems may be affected, in which case the plants usually die."
,Castor,Gray Mold," (fungus – ,): The entire group of flowers is attacked and converted to a prominent wooly mass of fungal growth. Also affects leaves and stems by infection from racemes. First symptoms are small, blackish spots from which drops of yellow may exude. Fungal threads which grow from these spots spread the infection and produce the characteristic wooly appearance of the inflorescence."
,Castor,Capsule Molds," (fungi – , sp., , sp., and , sp.): Capsules are attacked at an early stage of development. Capsules have distinctive bluish color in early stages. Color may become darker or black in later stages of development."
,Soybean,Anthracnose," (fungus – , var. ,): The fungus infects stems, petioles and pods of plants nearing maturity. Dark brown or reddish-brown areas may cover the surface of infected stems and pods. Lower branches die. Later, infected areas may become covered with the black fruiting bodies of the fungus. Seed in infected pods may be shriveled and moldy or show no external sign of the disease. The fungus is carried over on the seed. Germinating seed may be killed before they produce a seedling. Dark brown sunken cankers develop on the cotyledons of young seedlings. The fungus also overwinters on infected plant residue. Use of disease-free seed, crop rotation and burial of crop residue reduce disease incidence. Seed treatment improves stand, but will not eliminate the fungus. Foliar fungicides are recommended for control."
,Soybean,Brown Leaf Spot," (fungus – ,): This is the earliest foliar disease to appear on soybeans in the spring. Angular reddish-brown spots that vary in size from a pinpoint to 1/5 inch may appear on the lower leaves. Infected leaves turn yellow and fall prematurely. In severely infected fields, the lower half of the plant may lose all its leaves. The extent of defoliation depends on weather conditions following initial infection. Stems and young pods may also become infected. The disease may be seed-borne. The fungus overwinters on diseased stems and leaves. Warm, moist weather and poor drainage favor the spread of the disease. Control measures include use of disease-free seed, crop rotation, deep burial of crop residue and use of foliar fungicides."
,Soybean,Downy Mildew," (fungus – ,): First symptoms appear as indefinite yellowish-green areas on the upper leaf surface. Later, these areas become light to dark brown spots with yellow-green margins. Grayish downy tufts of mold growth appear on the lower surface. Severely infected leaves may defoliate prematurely. The fungus grows within pods covering the seed with a white crust of spores. The disease is spread with infected seed and is carried over on plant debris. Practice crop rotation, use disease-free seed, and plow under plant residue."
,Soybean,Purple Seed Stain," (fungus – ,): A pink or light to dark purple discoloration of the mature seed coat provides easy identification. Size of the discoloration may vary from a small spot to the entire seed surface. Affected seed may be cracked, rough and dull. Seed quality is lowered. The causal organism attacks other plant parts and overwinters in diseased leaves and stems as well as in infected seed. Premature defoliation may occur when leaves are severely infected. When infected seeds are planted, the fungus grows from seed coats and infects seedlings. This serves as a primary source of inoculum. Wet weather during the growing season favors development of the disease. The fungus overwinters in diseased crop residue as well as on infested seed. Crop rotation, use of disease-free seed and burial of crop residue aids in holding the disease in check. Foliar fungicides are effective for controlling this disease."
,Soybean,Seed Decay and Seedling Diseases," (fungi – , sp., , sp., , sp., , sp. are the most common): Poor seed quality, whether due to physical, physiological or pathological causes, predisposes seedlings to disease organisms. Poor seed quality is a major problem confronting soybean producers. Mechanical injury can rupture the seed coat allowing penetration of various pathogenic organisms or actually injury the embryo itself. Seed quality can be lowered by improper storage conditions, which include too high or too low moisture or temperatures. Both seed and soil-borne organisms can cause seed decay and seedling diseases. Seedlings infected with , or , usually develop a watery rot on roots and lower stems. , causes a dry rot with reddish-brown lesions, typical of “sore-shin”. Cool, wet soil conditions enhance seedling diseases. In poorly drained soils, plant soybeans on a slightly raised bed when temperatures have warmed up enough for rapid germination. Plant only high quality soybean seed if available. If planting seed germination is below 80 percent, use a seed treatment fungicide to increase germination."
,Soybean,Target Spot," (fungus – , sp.): Infection primarily on leaves, but may also occur on pods and stems. Spots on leaves are reddish-brown, circular in shape and vary in size from a pinpoint to more than 1/2 inch in diameter. Large spots are composed of concentric rings. The fungus is generally considered a weak parasite which attacks plants too late in the season to cause serious damage."
,Soybean,Bacterial Blight," (bacterium – , pv. ,): Usually, one of the first diseases to appear on young plants. Small, angular spots varying from yellow to dark brown develop on leaves of infected plants. The brown area is often surrounded by a water-soaked margin. Spots later dry and portions of the leaf may drop out. Leaves may have a torn, ragged appearance. The disease may occur on stems and pods. Cool, wet weather favors development of the disease. This disease is seed-borne and the bacteria may overwinter in crop residue. Plant disease-free seed. Bury crop residue and rotate with non-susceptible crops."
,Soybean,Charcoal Rot," (fungus – ,): Charcoal rot is usually found in mid-summer, mostly on sandy soils. This fungus is a weak pathogen and generally attacks young plants when their growth is retarded by drought. The fungus attacks the roots and lower stem. When the bark is peeled from the roots and stem base, tiny, black fungal bodies may be seen almost as if pepper had been sprinked on the tissue. The root and base of the stem exhibit streaks in the woody portion when split open. (See Charcoal Rot for additional information.)"
,Soybean,Frogeye Leafspot," (fungus – ,): This disease usually appears late in the growing season. The fungus infects leaves, stems and pods, but is most conspicuous on the leaf. On the leaf, it causes an “eyespot” lesion composed of a gray or tan central area surrounded by a narrow reddish border. Badly infected leaves fall prematurely. The fungus is seed-borne and causes weak seedlings. Control measures include planting disease-free seed, plowing under crop residue and rotation. Varieties vary in their resistance."
,Soybean,Rhizobium – Induced Chlorosis:, A chlorosis or yellowing ranging from light green to nearly white may occur about 6-8 weeks after planting when the plants are making rapid growth. This chlorosis is more apparent in the top 2-3 leaves and is caused by lack of nitrogen. This condition is caused by an insufficient amount of nodule-forming bacteria. The chlorosis is usually temporary and plants appear normal by flowering. There is usually no yield reduction. Correct application of inoculum will prevent this situation.
,Soybean,Southern Blight," (fungus – ,): Occurrence of southern blight in a field is erratic and generally only individual plants are affected. However, in some instances large numbers of plants may be killed. Southern blight produces a rot of the stem at and below the soil line. Plants may be affected at any stage of growth. The first symptom is sudden wilting and subsequent death. The fungus produces a whitish fungal growth on the stem base. Sclerotia, fungal resting bodies about the size of mustard seed, are formed. The sclerotia are the resting stage of the fungus and will persist in the soil for years. The fungus occurs widely in many soils, and is capable of persisting on almost any type of organic matter."
,Soybean,Bud Blight,"(virus – tobacco ringspot virus): The most serious virus disease of soybeans. The first symptoms occur on young plants; a curling and browning of the terminal bud forms a crook. The bud becomes dry and brittle, and the leaf immediately below it shows a flecking of rusty brown specks. Later buds die and the plant is stunted and produces no pods or small, underdeveloped ones. These plants are known as “duds” and are easily recognized in the fall because they remain green after normal plants have matured. Plants infected later in the season may produce poorly filled pods that drop prematurely or they may be covered with purple blotches and remain on the plant. The disease usually appears first at the edge of a field and progresses inward, suggesting an insect vector. These is no known control measure."
,Soybean,Soybean Mosaic," (virus): The most common virus disease occurring in Texas. Leaves of infected plants show a yellow vein clearing that develops in the small, branching veins of developing leaves. Infected leaves are narrower than normal with margins turned down. Margins later become ruffled and blister-like puckering occurs along the veins. Leaves become leathery in appearance, coarse and brittle. Symptoms become masked under higher summer temperatures. Infected plants produce misshapen pods and fewer seed than normal. The virus is carried in the seed and is transmitted by aphids. No control is known."
,Soybean,Bean Pod Mottle Virus, (virus): Symptoms first occur in the primary leaf stage. The virus causes a yellow-green mottling that may fade and reoccur later in the growing season. Cool weather enhances disease development. The virus is transmitted by the bean leaf beetle. No control is known.
,Soybean,Bacterial Pustule," (bacterium – , pv. ,): Primarily a disease of leaves, although it may infect pods. First symptoms are small, yellow-green spots with reddish-brown centers on the upper leaf surface. The central portion of each spot appears slightly raised and develops into a small pustule, especially on the underside of the leaf. Several infections on the same leaf produce a large, yellow to brown area with small, dark brown spots. The brown, dead areas on older leaves may break up and cause a ragged appearance. In later stages, the pustules rupture and dry. When rupturing and drying occur, it may be difficult to distinguish this disease from bacterial blight. Severe infections cause defoliation. The disease overwinters in infected plant debris and is carried over to some extent on infested seed. Crop rotation, resistant varieties and burial of crop residues are the most effective methods of disease control."
,Soybean,Cotton Root Rot," (fungus – ,): Plants die suddenly during the summer. Affected plants are easily pulled from the soil and have buff colored fungal strands on the lower stems and roots."
,Soybean,Pod and Stem Blight," (fungus – , var. ,): The pod and stem blight fungus attacks and kills older plants nearing maturity. The disease is identified by the numerous small, black fruiting bodies (pycnidia) appearing on stems and pods of infected plants. The pycnidia are arranged in linear rows on the stems and scattered on the pods. The fungus infects seed and causes them to be shriveled, moldy and smaller than normal. Seed may be infected, but appear normal. Seed infection is the most serious phase of the disease. When infected seed are planted, the embryo is often killed before emergence or the seedlings are killed at an early stage. Delayed harvest results in an increased incidence of the disease, especially if rain or humid weather and warm conditions prevail. Prompt harvesting when weather conditions permit and foliar fungicides are the most effective means of controlling this disease."
,Soybean,Root-Knot Nematode," (, spp.) Root-knot nematode infested plants are often stunted and have galls or knots on the roots. Plants may exhibit nutrient deficiencies and wilt during the heat of the day. These nematodes are more of a problem in sandy soil and seldom are damaging in heavy clay soils. Crop rotation and varietal resistance are effective in reducing losses to root-knot nematode."
,Soybean,Soybean Cyst Nematode Symptoms on Soybean," (,) The soybean cyst nematode (SCN) is the most serious pest of soybeans in the United States. To date, SCN has been observed in the state only in Northeast Texas (Bowie and Red River counties) and on the High Plains (Hale, Floyd and Swisher counties).,
Symptoms of SCN can be easily confused with nutrient deficiencies, herbicide injury and other disorders. Plants are typically stunted in patches within an affected field. The degree of damage depends upon the initial numbers of nematodes present, the degree to which the environment favors reproduction within a season, and the susceptibility of the soybean variety grown. The female nematodes can often be seen as tiny white to yellow, pinhead size specks on the surface of infested soybean roots. Damage to soybeans from SCN can be managed using resistant varieties, nematicides, and rotation. If SCN is suspected, a soil sample collected from the damaged area should be submitted to the Plant Nematode Diagnostic Laboratory."
,Soybean,Stem Canker," (fungus – , var. ,): In Texas, this disease was first discovered in 1984. The disease is seed transmitted, but once it becomes established in a field, the fungus survives in infected residue (primarily undecomposed stems). Spores are released from the residue in late spring/early summer and infect young vegetatively growing plants (V-4 stage or about 10-12″ in height). The infection moves down the petiole and establishes a canker on the lower stem usually on the 2nd, 3rd, or 4th node of the plant. As the plant enters the reproductive stage (R4-R6), the canker enlarges and girdles the stem. This prevents pod-filling, may result in premature plant death, and yield loss on susceptible varieties can exceed 90%. The first indication of stem canker from a distance is the appearance of yellowing leaves (R6-R7) showing an interveinal chlorosis. Plants exhibiting this symptom will often show a slightly sunken, brown area on the stem or base of a branch or petiole. The disease is usually scattered throughout a field when the field first becomes affected but in subsequent seasons, 80-90% of the plants may show symptoms when a susceptible variety is planted."
,Soybean,Recommended control measures," include the use of resistant varieties in fields where stem canker has become established. Crop rotation, delayed planting and plowing under crop residue may also reduce disease severity when planting moderately resistant or moderately susceptible varieties."
,Soybean,,
,Soybean,,
,Soybean,,
,Canola,Powdery Mildew," (fungus – ,): The symptoms are an extensive growth of white, powdery fungal mycelium on the upper leaf surface. Seed pods can also be infected. A severe infection can lead to premature leaf senescence, resulting in a lower yield."
,Canola,,
,Aloe,Soft Rot ,"– (unidentified bacterium): Leaves collapse to the ground [see illustration], as a result of decay originating in the crown. There is a water-soaked appearance to the leaves. Although the epidermis remains intact in this area, the tissue underneath is disintegrated. Leaves are easily detached from the crown. The causal agent has not yet been identified, but is presumed to be a bacterium. The disease seems to start in the crown area, where water accumulates. The heating of this water may be a predispositional factor for this disease. The disease is not common. The recommended control is to remove symtomatic plants from the field. Implements used to do this should be chemically disinfested."
,Aloe,Tip Dieback," – (physiological – oedema): The initial symptom is a water-soaked appearance at the tips of leaves [see illustration. The tissue remains rigid and the discoloration does not progress to the crown. Several days later, the affected portion dries and shrivels, leaving a string of firm, brown tissue, while the rest of the leaf remains green and succulent. This disorder is uncommon and occurs with certain weather patterns. It was documented early one summer when a period of overcast weather with heavy rain was followed by hot, sunny weather. Plants in waterlogged soil that were exposed to the sun were injured, while those that were shaded were not. There is no remedy for this injury, but leaves can still be processed if the affected portion is removed."
,Aloe,Slime Mold," – (non-pathogenic): Small (1-inch diameter), white globular bodies with a black powdery interior are often seen attached to lower portions of leaves. These are fungi known as slime molds and have never been implicated as causal agents of aloe diseases. No control measures are warranted."
,Aloe,,
,Sugarbeets,Crown and Root Rots," (fungi – , spp., , spp., , sp., , sp., ,, , sp., and several others): Crown rot and root rot appear as a wilting of leaves followed quickly by death. Roots have dark rotted areas and develop a strong odor in some cases. The rot starts at injured sides and at the crown. Disease is worse when plants suffer from water stress during the growing season. Control is accomplished through long rotations and proper use of fertilizer and irrigation to maintain uniform moisture."
,Sugarbeets,Powdery Mildew," (fungus – ,): This disease first appeared in 1974 on the Texas High Plains. A white powdery growth develops on the leaf surface. Severe infection causes reduced yield and decreased sugar content. Control by regular spray programs using fungicides."
,Sugarbeets,Leaf Spot ,"(fungus – ,): First symptoms are small, whitish spots scattered over the surface of older leaves. The spots increase in size, becoming brownish or purplish in color. Individual spots are usually circular but several may coalesce into larger areas of dead tissue. Mature spots, about 1/4-inch in diameter, become gray as the fungus produces spores. Leaves may become yellow and die. As leaves die, the crown becomes cone-shaped with a rosette of dead leaves at the base. The fungus overwinters on dead leaves and attacks other beets, lambsquarter and mallow. The disease develops rapidly when day temperature is 80 to 90,F. High humidity and a susceptible variety are conducive to severe epidemics. Control is accomplished through long rotations, resistant varieties and through preventive fungicide applications."
,Sugarbeets,Other Diseases,: Curly-top virus is a serious problem on sugar beet. (See separate section on curly-top. Nematodes cause serious losses in other beet production areas. Nematode control is also discussed separately.
,Sugarbeets,Phoma Leaf Spot," (fungus – ,): This fungus is common in early season and where sugar beets are grown, occuring mainly on older leaves. , leaf spot is of little economic importance. Symptoms are light brown leaf spots about 1 inch in diameter, with darker concentric rings. , is usually controlled by foliar applications for other fungi."
,Sugarbeets,,
,Sugarbeets,,
,Cotton,Ascochyta or Wet Weather Blight," – (fungus – ,): The disease is prevalent in most cotton producing areas of the state. Both seedlings and older plants are susceptible, but younger cotton is more seriously injured. An entire stand may be lost as a result of the fungus attacking the hypocotyl and killing the plant. Serious outbreaks of the disease may follow extended rainy periods with serious defoliation occurring. The damage is generally spotty and many plants recover when dry, warmer weather returns. The disease occurs on the leaves, stems and branches. First, small, round, reddish-brown spots with a dark brown border appear on the leaves. Later, the center of the lesions become ashy in color and may fall out. The lesions often occur at the base of the petiole. Defoliation may result from large lesions that coalesce. On stalks and branches, the lesions are dark brown, elongated and slightly sunken cankers. Under conditions favorable for the disease, the lesions may completely encircle the stem or branch and kill the plant above the lesions. The fungus may be seed-borne but it primarily survives in the soil on the infected plant residue. Use of acid delinted seed and suitable seed treatment fungicides will minimize carry-over. Plowing under plant residues and crop rotation also aid in reduction of the disease."
,Cotton,Cotton Root Rot," (fungus – ,): Root rot appears suddenly, starting in early summer. It causes rapid wilting, followed by death of the plants within a few days (Figure 3). Usually, the leaves of the plant are not shed, but remain attached. The disease kills plants in circular areas ranging from a few square yards to an acre or more in size. The root system of affected plants decay. Scraping the taproot reveals a darkened, reddish to wine-colored stain. If examined soon after death, the stems will be near normal color internally. Vascular streaking is not present as in the wilt disease. Fine, light brown strands of fungal threads (rhizomorphs) are usually found on the roots. Under moist conditions spore mats may appear on the soil surface near diseased plants. These are 2-12 inches in diameter, first snow-white and cottony, later tan and powdery. Controls include management and cultural practices as no chemical treatment has been found that economically controls cotton root rot. Deep plowing approximately 12 inches with mold board plow, planting early maturing varieties to escape disease, addition of organic matter or green manure and crop rotation have proven to be the most effective control methods. To achieve maximum control, an integrated program involving all practices is recommended."
,Cotton,Root Knot," (nematode – ,): The symptoms caused by root knot vary from slight plant stunting to death in areas of severe infestation. Skippy stands, particularly in distinct areas of a field, are characteristic. In skip-row cotton, where current rows are laid out perpendicular to the previous year’s row, stunted cotton outlining the old rows may be noticed. Root knots are small and should be checked on plants dug with a shovel and not those pulled by hand, since pulling plants often results in just the tap root being extracted. Control root knot nematodes by: rotation with sorghum or small grains, and use of in-furrow nematacides."
,Cotton,Nematodes Other Than Root Knot," (nematodes – lesion: , sp., spiral: , sp., lance: , sp., sting: , sp., stunt: , sp., reniform: ,): Of these nematodes, reniform is the most important in cotton production in Texas. It has been found in very small numbers in three counties in the High Plains, but it is most prevalent in the Rio Grande Valley area."
,Cotton,Verticillium Wilt," (fungus –,): Young plants infected with Verticillium wilt show yellow leaves and stunting, and often die. Following the seedling stage, older plants exhibit a chlorotic mottling on the leaf margins and between the major veins. (Figure 4) Plants attacked during later stages of growth display a mottling on the lower leaves first, later progressing toward the top of the plant as the season progresses. Often a single branch shows symptoms in the early stages of disease. Yellow progresses inward, followed by brown, and the leaf finally dies. Severely affected plants shed all their leaves and most of their young bolls. These plants may survive throughout the growing season and send out young sprouts or shoots from the base of the plant. Verticillium wilt is difficult to distinguish from Fusarium wilt. Leaf symptoms are similar and the internal tissues of the stems are discolored in both diseases. The only reliable way to distinguish the wilts is through a laboratory isolation of the fungus. The fungus causing Verticillium wilt can survive in the soil as small, dark resting bodies called sclerotia. The sclerotia can withstand adverse environmental conditions. Susceptible plants growing in Verticillium infested soil may not be severely attacked if environmental conditions are not suitable for fungal growth. The disease is more prevalent during periods of cool, wet weather. The fungus is not transmitted in seed, but can be introduced in the field by infested gin trash and burrs. The disease is more common on heavier soils than on light sandy soils. Control measures include avoiding excess nitrogen, crop rotation, shallow cultivation to avoid root pruning, avoiding excess irrigation, and planting resistant varieties."
,Cotton,Bacterial Blight," (bacterium – , pv. ,): Also known as angular leaf spot, vein blight, black arm and boll rot, depending on the portion of the plant infected. This organism affects all above ground parts of the cotton plant during any stage of its growth. Angular spots first appear on the leaves as water-soaked areas; the spots later turn dark brown to black and are covered with a glazed film. Often the surrounding tissue becomes yellow, giving a halo effect. Leaf spots are limited in size by leaf veins, which result in an angular shape. Infected leaves shed from seedlings and older plants. Occasionally, a black, water-soaked area occurs along a large vein in a leaf. Spots on bolls appear as round, water-soaked areas, but later turn dark brown or black. Spotted bolls may fail to open and lint may be discolored with a yellow stain. Before boll rot is evident, dark, irregularly shaped spots can be found on bracts surrounding the lower portion of the boll. Black spots or cankers may occur on the stems or branches (black arm) causing girdling and death of some branches. Overall, leaf spots and defoliation are the most noticeable symptoms and they are most likely to occur during or following rainy periods. Control measures depend largely on eliminating sources of infection and growing resistant or tolerant varieties. Since the bacterium overwinters in crop residue, plowing under the stubble immediately after harvest and practicing crop rotation will help reduce inoculum in the field. Acid delinting of cottonseed has eliminated carry-over. Most varieties have good resistance to bacterial blight."
,Cotton,Fusarium Wilt," (fungus – , f. sp. ,): Fusarium wilt is more prevalent in the lighter-textured acid soils of Texas. Unlike Verticillium wilt, seeds from diseased plants can become infected and serve to spread the fungus. The fungus may attack cotton seedlings, but the disease usually appears when the plants are more mature. Affected plants are first darker green and stunted, followed by yellowing of the leaves and loss of foliage. First, symptoms appear on lower leaves around the time of first flower. The leaf margins wilt, turn yellow, then brown, moving inward. Infected plants fruit earlier than normal with smaller bolls that open prematurely. A diagonal cut across the stem will reveal vascular discoloration just beneath the bark extending down the tap root. Wilting occurs rapidly following a rain preceded by a dry spell. Soils in which Fusarium wilt occurs also favor root knot nematodes and the two are often found together. Reniform nematodes (which occur mostly in the lower Rio Grande Valley) also predispose the plant to attack by the fungus. Control of nematodes is of major importance in reducing Fusarium wilt. Cultural practices effective for reducing Fusarium wilt losses include avoiding seed from infested fields in humid climates, rotation with non-susceptible crops, use of in-furrow nematacides, and varieties with resistance."
,Cotton,Rust," (fungus – ,): True cotton rust is quite distinct from the “rust” caused by potash deficiency. Cotton rust is confined to the Trans-Pecos area of West Texas, where it may reduce yields as much as 50 percent. Rust first appears as small, yellowish spots or pustules on leaves, bracts, green bolls, and stems. These enlarge, developing orange to reddish centers. Later, large orange pustules appear on the lower leaf surface and discharge orange spores (aeciospores). Several lesions on a leaf may cause it to shed. The rust lesions will also weaken stalks, stems and petioles, causing breakage on these parts. Broken stalks are more difficult to cultivate and harvest mechanically. The aeciospores released on the cotton do not reinfect cotton, but are windblown to wild gramma grass, which serves as an alternate host for the fungus. (Figure 7). A rainfall of « inch or more, followed by 12 – 18 hours of high humidity, is needed in June or early July for disease development. The only effective means of control is with an application of a mancozeb foliar fungicide before the cotton is infected. This is the only labeled fungicide, but it can not control the fungus after infection has occurred."
,Cotton,Virus Diseases,: Several virus diseases have been described on cotton but are only of minor importance in Texas
,Cotton,Boll Rots," (fungi and bacteria – caused by many parasitic and saprophytic organisms including: , sp. and , sp.): Symptoms may vary depending on the organisms involved. Generally, the first symptoms of boll rot are small, round, water-soaked spots on the bolls which may enlarge and become sunken and dark in color. Eternal symptoms may be absent but complete destruction of seed and fiber will occur. Infected bolls may be reduced by avoiding practices that promote rank growth, keeping cotton free of weeds and grasses, and skip- row planting. Heavy insect injury increases boll rot incidence. Boll rot is a problem of South and Central Texas. It is rarely seen on the High Plains."
,Cotton,Minor Leaf Spots," (fungi – , sp., , sp., , sp., , sp.): Two or more leaf spots may occur at the same time. Symptoms are varied, but generally these organisms cause circular concentric lesions similar to a target spot . These foliar diseases tend to be more prevalent at crop maturity and during periods of high humidity. Preventive control measures are most effective and include seed treatment, good management practices, and destruction of plant residue after harvest. Some varieties are more susceptible to late season leaf spot fungi."
,Cotton,Seedling Disease Complex," (fungi – ,, , sp., , sp., ,): Seedling disease is caused by a complex of soil fungi which may occur separately or in combinations. These fungi are , and ,. Symptoms include decay of the seed before germination, decay of the seedling before emergence, girdling of the emerged seedling at or near the soil surface, and rotting of root tips. Any one of these fungi or several working together can produce these symptoms."

,Corn,Bacterial Leaf Blight," (bacterium – ,): This disease is also called Stewart’s bacterial wilt, Stewart’s leaf blight and maize bacteriosis, and is rarely found in Texas. Leaves show linear, pale green-yellow streaks with irregular margins that parallel veins. These streaks become dry and brown. Plants produce premature, bleached, dead tassels. Severely infected plants form cavities in the pith of the lower stalk and the bacteria spread through the vascular system into the kernels. Chewing insects, such as flea beetles, wireworms, root worms and May beetles can spread the bacterium. Field corn is more resistant than sweet corn. Control by using resistant hybrids and control chewing insects."
,Corn,Brown Spot," (fungus – ,): Brown spot is generally not a serious problem. Symptoms are small, round, yellow spots on leaves and sheathes that appear in bands across the leaf (,). Lesions turn brown and blend together to form larger blotches . Infected leaf tissue decomposes, releasing brown spores. Stalks often break and lodge."
,Corn,Common Rust ,"(fungus – ,): The fungus erupts from the leaf tissue in round to oval areas called pustules, with cinnamon brown spores (,). These spores eventually turn black. Rust is favored by cool temperatures and high humidity. Older tissue is generally resistant. There are numerous physiologic races of this fungus. Control disease with slow rusting resistant hybrids (,). Fungicides are usually not economically practical. High summer temperatures usually reduce the disease."
,Corn,Common Smut," (fungus – ,): All parts of the plant are susceptible. Galls are covered with a white membrane. The inside of the gall turns into a mass of powdery black spores (,). Early infection may kill small plants but this is rare. A gall on the lower part of the stalk can make the ears small or non-existent. Dry weather with 78oF – 95oF is favorable. High nitrogen or heavy manure is also favorable. Injuries from blowing sand, hail damage, cultivation, or buggy-whipping will increase smut. Avoid mechanical injury, avoid highly susceptible varieties, and maintain balanced fertility."
,Corn,Crazy Top," (fungus – ,): Symptoms vary with time of infection and degree of colonization. First symptoms are excessive tillering, rolling, and twisting of upper leaves. The tassel proliferates until it is just a mass of leaves, hence the name crazy top . Leaves may also be stunted with yellow stripes. Flowering before plants reach the four- to five-leaf stage is usually a factor. Losses are usually confined to small areas. Avoid wet fields with poor drainage."
,Corn,Ear and Kernel Rots," (fungi – several species): Corn ear and kernel rots are a greater problem in areas with high rain fall from silking to harvest. Symptoms range from pink mold on ears with Fusarium to green mold with Tricoderma (See , and ,). Moldy corn may contain toxic materials (see section on mycotoxins for detailed information). Bird and insect damage to ear and stalks along with lodging will increase stalk rots. Rots are reduced in ears that mature hanging downward. Yield, quality, and feed value can be reduced. Controls include resistant hybrids, early harvest, and proper storage below 15% moisture."
,Corn,Head Smut ,"(fungus – ,): This soil-borne fungus attacks both corn and sorghum. It appears on the ear and tassels. Tassel infection may be from individual spihelets or a large mass of black spores (,). Smutted ears are small and tear-drop shaped, with no evidence of a cob or kernels inside (,). Usually if the tassels are smutted, all the ears will be smutted. Controls include resistant varieties or hybrids and rotation."
,Corn,Nematodes:," In general, nematodes decrease the efficiency of the root system, resulting in reduced growth, yellowing and reduced yields. More than 40 species have been reported on corn. The main symptoms on corn are lack of vigor and dark, discolored areas on the roots. Rotate with non-host plants and use chemical infurrow treatments where practical (,)."
,Corn,Northern Corn Leaf Blight," (fungus – ,): Long, elliptical, tan lesions develop first on older lower leaves (,). It progresses up the plant and resembles frost or drought injury (,). Lesions form on husks but ears are not infected. Lesions on resistant hybrids have a yellow margin (,). It overwinters on leaves, husks, and other plant parts in debris. In wet weather, black spores are produced on the lesions that are wind-blown long distances. Secondary spread is common within and between fields. Moderate temperatures, heavy dews, and frequent showers are favorable. High losses will occur with infection before silking. Infection six weeks after silking will cause minimal loss. Control with resistant hybrids. Check for approved fungicides. Section 18 emergency exemptions for Tilt have been available in the past."
,Corn,Seed Rots and Seedling Blight," (fungi – several species): Soil and seed-borne fungi attack corn seed causing seed rots and seedling blight. These fungi are favored by cold (50oC – 55oC) wet, poorly drained soils. Factors that affect disease severity include genetic resistance, seed quality, planting depth, and soil type. Symptoms include yellowing and wilt of leaves, seed rot, damping-off of seedlings, seedling wilt, and root rot. Controls include planting high quality damage-free seed, planting in warm, moist soil, correct placement of infurrow pesticides and fertilizer, and seed treatment fungicides (,)."
,Corn,Sorghum Downy Mildew," (fungus – ,): Symptoms are yellow, stunted plants with occasional white striped leaves. Infection is systemic. Infected plants have narrow, more erect leaves. Plants will have bushy tassels and downy white growth will appear on both leaf surfaces. Tolerant plants show some symptoms but still produce seed. Some varieties show long, narrow, yellow lesions. Spores can blow from plant to plant or field to field. Other spores survive for years in the soil. Use resistant hybrids and systemic fungicide seed treatment."
,Corn,Southern Corn Leaf Blight," (fungus – ,): This was a minor disease of corn for many years, with no economic effect on yield. In 1970, a highly virulent strain called Race T appeared on corn hybrids with Texas male sterile cytoplasm (,). Losses were severe. Symptoms of Race lesions are spindle-shaped with yellow-green halos. They will later have dark, reddish-brown borders and occur on leaves, stalks, leaf sheaths, husks, and shanks. Cob Rot ear occurs as well as ear drop. The fungus overwinters in corn debris and on seed. Wind and splashing water spread the spores rapidly in the field under ideal conditions, cycling in about 72 hours. Control with resistant hybrids."
,Corn,Southern Corn Rust," (fungus – ,): Southern rust develops more rapidly and is more destructive to leaf tissue than common rust, but it occurs primarily along the Coastal Bend as far north as Hempstead. Southern rust pustules are smaller, more round and orange in color than common rust. The many pustules that form cause the leaf to turn yellow and die. Yields are reduced by heavy infection at ear filling. Unlike common rust, southern rust is favored by high temperature. Corn hybrids vary in susceptibility to this disease. Resistant hybrids should be planted. Chemical control is available to growers through mancozeb fungicides."
,Corn,Stalk Rots," (fungi – several species): Stalk rots are the world’s most destructive corn diseases. They are caused by a complex of fungi and bacteria that attack the stalks near maturity. Stalk rots are favored by conditions that encourage heavy kernel set followed by late season stress, such as leaf blights, extended cloudiness, heavy plant stands, drought, hail, and low K with high N. Most stalk rots are favored by dry conditions early and warm, wet weather after silking. Symptoms include destruction of pith in the stalk and lodging (,). Interior discoloration ranges from pink with Gibberella to gray with charcoal rot (,). Yield reductions of 10 – 20% are common with susceptible hybrids. Losses occur from both poorly filled ears and harvest losses due to lodging. Controls include using disease-free seed of resistant hybrids, crop rotation, balanced N and K fertility, sanitation, stress reduction such as pest control, and reduced plant populations."
,Corn,Maize Dwarf Mosaic Virus," (virus – maize dwarf mosaic virus (MDMV)): This is the most common and most damaging of corn viruses in Texas. Youngest leaves have a light to dark green mottle or mosaic in narrow streaks along veins (,). Plants are stunted (,), excessively tillered, with multiple ear shoots and poor seed set. Early infection can lead to root and stalk rots and death. The virus is transmitted mechanically by at least 12 different aphids. Symptoms appear 30 days after emergence. Many wild and cultivated grasses serve as hosts for MDMV. Johnsongrass is considered the main overwintering reservoir. Use resistant hybrids and control Johnsongrass."
,Corn,,
,Barley,Barley Stripe Mosaic ,(virus): Barley stripe mosaic is a seed-borne virus which causes yellow or light-green stripes or streaks of the leaves.
,Barley,Barley Yellow Dwarf Virus," (virus): Yellowing of leaves is the first visible sign that a plant is diseased. When infection occurs in a plant during the seedling stage, the leaves turn a bright golden yellow, usually beginning at the tips and progressing back along the edges. In very susceptible varieties, plants infected in the seedling stage are severely dwarfed and may grow less than six inches tall. They produce more tillers than healthy plants but form no heads. Several species of aphids can carry the virus from infected grasses to barley. Use resistant varieties (,)."
,Barley,Basal Glume Blotch," (bacterium – ,): Basal glume blotch on barley is caused by a bacterium. It is caused by the same bacterium that occurs commonly on wheat. The symptom of basal glume blotch is dull brownish-black, discolored area found at the base of each glume covering the kernel. The discoloration is more pronounced on the inside than on the outside of the diseased glume. The base of a diseased kernel shows a discoloration varying from faint brown to charcoal black with the color depending upon the severity of the attack. Leaves affected by this disease organism show small, dark, water-soaked spots. These spots tend to enlarge and turn yellow and finally brown as the tissue dies. The use of clean and treated seed will reduce the severity of this disease."
,Barley,"Foot Rot, Take-all, and Rhizoctonia Root Rot and Sharp Eyespot:", These diseases affect both barley and wheat and are described in the wheat section.
,Barley,Leaf Blotch," (fungus – ,): The spots characteristic of leaf blotch are elongated and yellowish-brown, and their ends have indefinite margins. Numerous dark-brown fruiting bodies develop in rows between the veins in the dead, straw-colored parts of the spots. Control is the same as for spot blotch."
,Barley,Leaf Rust," (fungus – ,): Small, round yellow or yellowish-brown pustules appear on the leaves (,). Infected leaves eventually die. Leaf rust of barley does not infect oats or wheat. The development of resistant varieties is currently the only practical means of control (,)."
,Barley,Nematodes,": Lesion, spiral, stubby root and stunt nematodes feed on the roots and can result in poor root development. Plants will be stunted and in most cases show an off-color as a nutritional deficiency. Frequent turning of the soil during summer months tends to lower populations."
,Barley,Net Blotch," (fungus – ,): Net blotch of barley is principally a leaf disease. The spots are internal with a characteristic netting (,). The netted pattern, formed by the arrangement of brown pigment in transverse and longitudinal lines, can best be seen if the leaf is held against the light. The elongated, brown-netted areas finally cover most of the leaf and destroy it usefulness. The fungus causing net blotch may be carried on the seed or infection may come from old straw or stubble. Crop rotation, plowing old straw and stubble, and seed treatment will aid in prevention of this disease. Avoid susceptible varieties (,)."
,Barley,Powdery mildew," (,); Gray, fluffy threads of the fungus can be observed on the upper surface of the leaves and leaf sheaths. The fungal strands penetrate and invade the leaf tissue. As the disease progresses, the leaf turns yellow and is gradually killed. Spores of the fungus are carried from plant-to-plant by wind currents. While the disease can be controlled with fungicides (,), such controls may not be economical. Some resistant varieties are available (,)."
,Barley,Smut ,"(fungi – ,): Three smuts occur on barley in Texas, but with seed treatment fungicides now available (,), each can be controlled. Covered smut (,) is noticed at heading time. Hard, black masses of smut, each covered with a grayish membrane, are found in place of kernels. Semi-loose smut (,) destroys the floral parts and entire head. Spores of the nigra smut are carried within the husk covering or on the seed. Loose smut (,) is similar to semi-loose smut except the smut fungus is internally seed-borne."
,Barley,Spot Blotch," (fungus – ,): Spot blotch infection starts as dark brown-to-black spots on sheaths that cover the young shoots. The infection progresses inward and sometimes kills the seedlings below the surface of the ground, but more often it kills the seedlings after emergence. Diseased seedlings are dwarfed and tiller excessively. The leaf spot has round to oblong dark brown lesions. Spots may coalesce to form blotches. As crown rot, the disease develops at or near the soil line. Crown roots may be rotted and tillers killed. The pathogen can be soil- or seed-borne, and may be carried on crop residue. Seed treatment with a fungicide (,), reduces losses from seedling infection. Clean plowing of crop residue and crop rotation will aid in control."
,Barley,Stem Rust," (fungus – ,): Pustules break through the stem and leaf tissue. Rusted stems turn brown, become dry and brittle and may lodge. Control is the same as for leaf rust."

,Strawberry,Anthracnose complex," (fungi – ,spp.): All plant parts are susceptible to one of the three major fungal species. Crown rot, caused by ,, is primarily a plant production problem in annual systems. Plants become infected in nurseries but show no symptoms until transplanted to production fields. High temperatures trigger symptom development. Plants die quickly. It is essential to acquire disease free transplants. The other , species cause fruit rot, flower blight or leaf spots. Stolons and petioles can also be infected. Rigorous fungicide programs are necessary to minimize losses to anthracnose diseases. Under favorable conditions for disease development, chemical control may give disappointing results. Varieties vary in susceptibility."
,Strawberry,Black Root Rot," (various fungi): The exact cause of black root rot is unknown. It has been associated with several different organisms or conditions. The symptoms of black root rot are a black and woody root system. On healthy plants, the roots will appear white and pliable; however, diseased plants will have stiff roots. The feeder roots are partially or completely destroyed. The tip of the main roots will be destroyed. Fumigation has helped with this problem."
,Strawberry,Cercospora Leaf Spot," (fungus – ,spp.): This is one of the more common, but usually minor, leaf spots of strawberry. It occurs in all areas of Texas. At first, small round purple spots are seen on the upper side of the leaves. As the leaf matures, the center of the spot becomes tan or gray then almost white while the edges of the spot remain purple. On the underside of the leaf, the spots are bluish or tan in color. Varieties vary in their resistance to , leaf spot."
,Strawberry,Fruit Rots," (fungi – , spp. plus others): Fruit rots destroy a large percentage of the fruit each year in Texas. There are several organisms involved in this complex and symptoms are somewhat different for each fungus. Gray mold rot (Botrytis) is the most damaging. It attacks green fruit as well as ripe fruit. The first sign of infection is a small, brown, soft spot. Ripe fruit rapidly rots, becoming covered with a gray moldy growth. , attacks ripe fruit that in most cases contacted soil. The disease is called hard rot. Affected berries are usually one sided. Fruit rot control is achieved with chemical applications and cultural practices. Maintain good air circulation by not crowding plants. Avoid excessive fertility rates."
,Strawberry,Leaf Scorch," (fungus – ,): The disease is similar to Cercospora leaf spot. At first, small dark purple spots up to one-fourth of an inch in diameter appear on the upper side of the leaves. These spots never have light centers as do those of Cercospora leaf spot and they have a more irregular outline. The fungus can also attack other parts of the plant. Some varieties have resistance to leaf scorch. Fungicide applications at repeated intervals should give adequate control."
,Strawberry,Red Stele," (fungus – ,): Red stele is the most serious root disease of strawberries. It occurs during the late winter and spring. The fungus attacks only strawberries and is spread from one area to another primarily through diseased plants. In a healthy plant, the roots are a yellowish-white and in a diseased plant, the center is a distinctive brownish-red. Infected plants are stunted and wilt in dry weather. The root systems have a rattail appearance with few lateral roots produced. The disease is more disastrous in low, poorly drained fields during cool weather. There are no chemical or cultural methods for reducing disease losses, except to replant resistant varieties. The fungus does not persist in well drained soils."
,Strawberry,Verticillium Wilt," (fungus – ,): This is a widespread soil-borne disease of strawberries growing in cool, poorly drained soils. Symptoms show up as a burning of the outer margins of the leaves. Young roots turn black at the tips and die back. If Verticillium has been a problem in your area, consider a variety which has resistance to the wilt organism. Soil fumigation with a chloropicrin-containing fumigant is recommended when resistant varieties are not available. When using soil fumigants, follow manufacturer’s directions and use caution in handling the material."
,Strawberry,,
,Plum,Bacterial Canker," (bacterium – ,): Cankers develop at the base of infected buds on trunk and scaffold limbs. Cankers spread more rapidly above the point of infection than below and only slightly to the sides. This results in a long, narrow canker. Cankers develop during the fall and winter but are not visible until late winter and early spring. Damaged areas are slightly sunken and somewhat darker in color than surrounding bark. As the trees break dormancy in the spring, gum is formed and flows down the outside of the tree. Cankers have a soured smell. The bacterium is a weak pathogen and causes serious damage only when a tree is in a near dormant condition or weakened due to unfavorable growing conditions. Avoid using high fertilizer rates in late summer. Succulent, late fall growth is more easily infected. Prune when trees are fully dormant (January and February). Trees showing signs of bacterial canker should be left and pruned after all other trees have been completed."
,Plum,Brown Rot ,"(fungus – ,): The brown rot fungus can cause blossom blight or fruit rot. Surface moisture and moderately warm temperatures encourage its development. Fruit damaged by wind, hail, insects, or mechanical means is more susceptible to this organism. Infected blossoms are brown and water-soaked. The fungus grows down the pedicel into the stem which may cause twig dieback. Diseased blossoms and fruit generally become covered with “tufts” of brown fungal material (,). Fruit infection usually occurs near maturity. The fungal organism overwinters in mummies, stem cankers and old fruit peduncles. Control is by repeated fungicide applications (,) and sanitation."
,Plum,Bacterial Spot of Plum," (bacterium – ,): Symptoms are observed first as small, irregularly shaped lesions. The spots are pale green in contrast to the dark green surrounding tissue. In advanced stages, angular lesions are formed, surrounded by a halo of lighter colored tissue. The inner portion of the lesion turns black and drops out. This gives the leaf a “ragged” or “shot hole” appearance. Leaves heavily infected with bacterial spot turn yellow and fall. Leaf spots are concentrated toward the distal end of the leaf. Fruit infection is not as common as foliage infection. When it occurs, small spots develop and gum may flow from these spots. Highly susceptible varieties like Methley and Santa Rosa are more likely to have fruit infections than Morris, Bruce or Ozark Premier. The bacterium overwinters on infected twigs. Chemical control (,) has not been highly effective. Early and late dormant copper sprays will aid in control. Optimum nutrition is also important."
,Plum,Rust ,"(fungus – ,): Initial symptoms are minute yellow spots on the upper leaf surfaces. As the fungus develops, reddish to dark brown colored rust lesions break open on the lower leaf surfaces (,). The specific rust fungus attacking plums does not attack peaches. Rust is usually a late season problem that causes rapid defoliation. If defoliation is repeatedly premature, production can be affected. Chemical control (,) is a viable option but generally not necessary. Bruce and Morris are susceptible. Methley, Santa Rosa, Ozark Premiere and Allred are tolerant or resistant."
,Plum,Cherry Leaf Spot," (fungus – ,): Infected leaves have small circular purple lesions which turn brown and eventually drop out. This gives the foliage a ragged or shot hole appearance. Rainfall is necessary for disease development. Protective fungicides applied for other diseases gives economical control. This is considered a minor disease on plums."
,Plum,Black Knot on Plum," (fungus – ,): Affected limbs and twigs are malformed as a result of black woody growths (galls). The galls are similar to those caused by crown gall on the root system. The disease is more prevalent on the small twigs, but under severe disease conditions it may be found on large limbs. Infection of new shoots occurs from bloom until shuck split stage. Primary inoculum comes from one to two year old galls. Control of black knot is by sanitation, chemicals and resistant varieties. Prune and destroy the galled tissue. Make cuts two or three inches below the gall to insure complete removal of the fungus. Fungicides applied (,) in the early bloom periods will help reduce the occurrence of this disease."
,Plum,Plum Pockets," (fungus – ,): Plum pockets are a fruit disorder of little economic importance. Infection occurs soon after bud break under cool, wet conditions. The skin of the fruit is first a reddish color and then a velvety gray. Infected fruit becomes distorted and puffy. The disease is similar to peach leaf curl except fruit rather than leaves are attacked. A fungicide program (,) used to control peach leaf curl will also control plum pockets."

,Pear,Fire Blight," (bacterium – ,): The bacterium causing fire blight overwinters at the margins of the cankers formed on twigs and branches in the previous season. Active bacteria are in the healthy tissue next to the canker rather than in the canker. In the spring the bacteria begin to multiply at the same time growth starts. As the bacterium increases, an ooze is formed at the margin of the canker. Insects are attracted to the ooze and it is carried to the open blossoms. Splashing rain can also spread the bacterium. Once bacteria enter a blossom, the blossoms are blighted within 7-10 days after infection. Bacteria continues to be spread further by insects visiting the blighted blossom and carrying the bacteria to adjoining blossoms. Spread by honey bees is increased during periods of warm temperature, sunshine, and still air. After blossom infection, bacteria spread into the fruit peduncle and finally into the twig. Ooze is continually being produced which can add to secondary infection. During periods of high humidity, the bacteria can enter into young leaves. Fire blight is favored by a mean temperature of 60oF or above. The control of fire blight is based on several steps:"
,Pear,Leaf Blight and Fruit Spot ,"(fungus –,): Leaf spots first appear as small purple spots which enlarge. As the spots get older, they develop purple margins with brown centers. Fruit spots are one-fourth inch in diameter, black, and slightly depressed. They sometimes coalesce to cover a large portion of the fruit surface. Lesions also occur on twigs and are the overwintering inoculum. In the spring, twig lesions produce spores which are washed by rainfall to leaves. After infection there is a period of one week before symptoms are observed. Secondary infection can occur during the spring and summer when the temperature is near 75oF. and surface moisture is on the leaves. Fungicides should be applied at full leaf development and continued at two week intervals for four sprays."
,Pear,Bitter Rot," (fungus – ,): The fungus attacks apples and pears and enters the fruit through uninjured skin. Infected fruit are characterized by a firm rot which forms a circular light brown spot. With age the spots become almost black and have a saucer-shaped depression. The organism overwinters in decayed fruit and in cracks on the old bark. A broken limb or twig will serve as an overwintering site. Symptoms are first noticeable in mid to late July. A temperature of 85oF and light rain favor development of the rot. Good sanitation will help reduce losses from this disease. Remove all broken limbs and decayed fruit. Once the disease begins to show up, spray at seven day intervals for two or three applications."
,Pear,Black Rot," (fungus – ,): Black rot is a firm-textured rot. The spot at first is light brown but darkens with age. A circle of raised dark postules are formed in the center of the spot. Infected leaves are covered with many small purple specks. At maturity the spots are purplish cast with brown centers. Twig infections are small, sunken, reddish-brown areas. The organism overwinters in cankers, decayed fruit, and dead wood. In the spring spores are formed in the cankers. Leaves are the first tissue to be infected. A temperature of 80oF. and rainfall encourage disease development. Infection generally takes place at the blossom end of the fruit as it reaches maturity. Sanitation is one of the more important means of control. Remove all dead twigs, limbs, and decayed fruit. Fungicides must be applied when the fruit is beginning to expand in the spring."
,Pear,Bot Rot," (fungus – ,): The fungus attacks both woody tissues and fruit. On limbs, new infection shows up as small blisters. These lesions serve as a source of inoculum for next spring. Fruit infection results in small, reddish-brown spots which develop rapidly causing a soft rot. A temperature of 75oF or above favors the development of the fungus. Bot rot is most damaging on weak trees. During periods of rapid twig growth, the diseased area will be sloughed off. Prune out any dead or diseased wood. Fungicides will need to be applied from immediately after bloom until near harvest."
,Pear,Pear Scab," (fungus – ,): Symptoms of apple scab and pear scab are similar except pear scab will attack twigs. Twigs are a source of early spring inoculum. The control program for apple scab will also control pear scab."
,Pear,Stony Pit," (virus): This disease is one of the more common viruses found on pears in Texas. The outer flesh of infected fruit is gnarled and deformed. When the fruit is cut, it has brown, hard structures scattered throughout the flesh."

,"Peach, Apricot, and Nectarine",Armillaria Root Rot: ,"This can be a major disease in older orchards and replanted orchards. (,) (See Section on Mushroom Root Rot)"
,"Peach, Apricot, and Nectarine",Bacterial Canker," (bacterium – ,): Elongated cankers develop at the base of buds and randomly on the trunk and scaffold limbs (,). Damaged areas are slightly sunken and somewhat darker in color than the surrounding bark. At both the upper and lower margins of the canker, narrow brown streaks extend into healthy tissue. As the trees break dormancy in the spring, gum is formed by the surrounding tissue and may exert enough pressure to break through the bark and flow. The area beneath the canker has a soured odor. Individual scaffolds or the entire tree usually dies shortly after leafing out in the spring. Roots are not affected. Extensive suckering (,) often occurs at the tree base. The bacterium is a weak pathogen and causes serious damage only when a tree is in a dormant condition or weakened due to unfavorable growing conditions. Bacterial canker is a component in a disease complex known as Peach Tree Short Life. Trees up to 7 years old, growing on deep sandy soil are most susceptible. Avoid using high nitrogen fertilizer rates in mid to late summer. Do not encourage late fall growth. Prune when the trees are fully dormant (January and February). High dosage of a copper-containing fungicide at leaf drop has been somewhat successful."
,"Peach, Apricot, and Nectarine",Bacterial Spot," (bacterium – , pv. ,): Symptoms on leaves are observed first as small, circular, or irregularly shaped, pale green lesions (,). During early development, lesions almost always are concentrated near the leaf tip. In advanced stages, the inner portion of the lesion falls out, giving the leaf a “ragged” or “shot hole” appearance. Leaves heavily infected with bacterial spot turn yellow and fall. Repeated infection can occur throughout the growing season as long as the environment is favorable. Symptoms first appear on fruit as small, olive brown, circular spots. Spots become slightly darker and depressed as the bacteria develops. Lesions are scattered over the fruit surface and tiny cracks develop in the center of the spots. Sometimes symptoms resemble peach scab (,). Leaf infection is more common than fruit infections. Apparently, more specific climatic conditions are necessary for fruit to become infected. Chemical control during the season is difficult. Dormant sprays have been somewhat effective if the spray is timed to protect stems during the fall infection period. Copper containing fungicides should be applied just as the leaves begin to shed. Resistant varieties are available. (,)"
,"Peach, Apricot, and Nectarine",Brown Rot ,"(fungus – ,): The brown rot fungus causes blossom blight and fruit rot, but fruit rot is the most common. Surface moisture and moderately warm temperatures favor disease development. With blossom blight, flowers turn brown and are water-soaked. The fungus grows down the pedicel into the stem resulting in dark brown, sunken areas (,). Young stems are often girdled causing twig dieback. In some instances, young fruit may become infected but not show symptoms until the fruit matures. Generally, fruit are resistant to infection during the hard green stages of development. Fruit are most susceptible near maturity. The fungus enters fruit directly or through natural openings or wounds. A brown, water-soaked lesion rapidly develops (,). The brown rot fungus overwinters in mummies, stem cankers and on infected fruit peduncles. Beetles or other insects can be vectors for the fungus. Control by applying a fungicide (,) during pink bud, bloom, petal fall, and at preharvest. Post harvest decay can be serious if fruit is not protected. Nectarines are more susceptible than peaches."

,"Peach, Apricot, and Nectarine",Crown Gall:," (See Section on ,)"
,"Peach, Apricot, and Nectarine",Fungal Gummosis," (fungus – ,): The fungus enters through wounds or lenticels on lower parts of scaffold limbs and the trunk. Older infection sites typically exude gummy resin. Necrosis is associated with infection but usually is restricted to the area just under the bark. Over time the bark develops a rough texture. Trees can recover somewhat if infection is not severe. Stressed trees are damaged the most. (,)"
,"Peach, Apricot, and Nectarine",Leucostoma Canker," (fungus – , – anamorph ,): The fungus is a weak pathogen and is rarely a problem in well managed orchards with rapidly growing trees. Pimple-like bumps develop on the surface of cankers. During the growing season small streams of gum are formed at each pimple. In most cases a callus layer forms around the damaged area and the canker is walled off. In a few cases the canker growth will resume in the fall after the callus growth is slowed. Leucostoma canker may become established in a limb through pruning cuts or sunburn injury. Affected trees should be pruned to remove the canker sites and fertilized to promote growth. (,)"

,"Peach, Apricot, and Nectarine","Oxyporus Root,Crown Rot"," and , (fungus – ,sp.): The fungus forms a thick, white to slightly off-white fungal mat at the base of tree trunks. Trees infected with ,show a slow decline. There are no specific controls."
,"Peach, Apricot, and Nectarine",Peach Leaf Curl," (fungus – ,): The peach leaf curl fungus infects leaves, flowers, and fruits. Infected leaves are characterized by puckering, thickening and curling. Diseased leaves become pale yellow to light green and shed after a short time (,). Fruit and blossoms shed when infected and are seldom observed by growers. Disease development is related to air temperature at the time buds are opening. If surface moisture is present and the air temperature is near 68oF, infection can take place. Temperatures above 86oF and below 40oF inhibit the fungus. After symptoms are visible, control is impossible. Apply a fungicide (,) at the beginning of dormancy and/or just prior to bud break."
,"Peach, Apricot, and Nectarine",Peach Mosaic," (virus): This viral disease affects peach and plum. General symptoms are delayed foliation, and small, narrow, crinkled, mottled, yellow leaves. Internodes are shortened, and lateral buds break, giving a rosette appearance. The few fruit produced are deformed resulting in bumpy, misshapen, small fruit. Spread is by grafting and the peach bud mite, Eriophyes insidiosus. Remove all virus-infected trees as soon as they are discovered."
,"Peach, Apricot, and Nectarine",Peach Scab," (fungus – ,): Peach scab, also known as “freckles,” is found wherever peaches are grown. It is most apparent on mid-late season varieties. Small spots develop on fruit and are normally concentrated around the stem or shoulder of the fruit (,). Lesions formed on young twigs serve as a means of overwintering. Primary infection in the spring comes from spores produced in twig cankers formed the previous year. Fruit infection normally occurs after shuck split and 2-4 weeks following. Once infection occurs, 40 to 70 days may elapse before symptoms are visible. Control is by repeated applications of an approved fungicide (,) during the critical period beginning at shuck split."
,"Peach, Apricot, and Nectarine",Peach Yellows," (phytoplasma): The disease has been observed in Texas but is rarely found. Fruits on diseased trees ripen from a few days to three weeks prematurely, have a bitter taste, and are reduced in size. Varieties which normally have red skin are abnormally bright. Leaves are chlorotic, fold upward, and tend to droop. Infected trees leaf out prematurely. The disease is spread by grafting and feeding by the plum leafhopper , (Fitch). After infection, it may be 40 days to three years before disease symptoms are visible. Use only bud wood from healthy trees and destroy any trees which show typical disease symptoms."
,"Peach, Apricot, and Nectarine",Phony Peach," (bacterium – ,): This disease does not cause rapid death of trees but results in reduced growth and fruit size. Twigs on diseased trees have shortened internodes and increased lateral branching. The general appearance is a dwarfed, compact growth pattern with dark green foliage. After a few years, the wood becomes brittle and terminal dieback is common. Infected trees leaf out first in the spring and hold their foliage later in the fall. Fruit also ripens earlier on diseased trees. Disease is spread by root grafting and leafhoppers. Remove all trees showing symptoms of phony peach and destroy wild plums growing near the orchard."
,"Peach, Apricot, and Nectarine",Phytophthora Root Rot," (fungus – ,spp.): Roots infected by this fungus show extensive root necrosis. Although Phytophthora Root Rot has not been verified in Texas, its presence is suspected based on its wide distribution. Phytophthora Root Rot is most severe on replant sites or in orchards planted on poorly drained soils."
,"Peach, Apricot, and Nectarine",Rhizopus Rot," (fungus – ,): This fungus is most active during warm, humid weather. Fruit infection results in a “black whiskered” appearance caused by fungal strands which produce an abundance of black spores. Rhizopus attacks peaches and plums only at maturity. Disease prevention is primarily based on orchard sanitation, preharvest fungicides, and rapid refrigeration of processed fruit. Picking containers should be such that fruit receives a minimum amount of handling. Packing equipment should cause minimum injury. Pad any area where fruit will drop onto a belt or roller."
,"Peach, Apricot, and Nectarine",Root Knot," (Nematode – ,spp.) Use resistant rootstocks. (See ,)"
,"Peach, Apricot, and Nectarine",Rust," (fungus – ,): Reddish-brown pustules occur on the lower leaf surface marked by a yellow spot on the upper surface (,). It causes premature defoliation which reduces tree vigor. The rust species that infects peach does not infect plum. In most parts of Texas rust is a late season disease that generally does not require treatment. (,)"
,"Peach, Apricot, and Nectarine",Shot Hole," (fungus – ,): Was formerly called Coryneum blight. Blight lesions on leaves are small, circular, purple spots. In advanced stages spots on the leaves fall out giving the leaf a ragged appearance. Defoliation seldom occurs unless infection is severe. Fruit infection is rare. Buds and twigs die if heavily infected. For most effective disease control, apply dormant sprays immediately after leaves are shed or just prior to budbreak in spring. (,)"
,"Peach, Apricot, and Nectarine",Waterlogging," (physiological): Peach and nectarines, more so than apricots, require well drained soil for good growth. Prolonged periods of waterlogged soil depletes soil oxygen which is deadly to roots. Foliage may turn yellow and shed or develop a reddish purple color. Dead roots are deep purple to black inside and have a foul odor (,). Where needed, terrace land for optimum drainage and plant on raised beds."
,"Peach, Apricot, and Nectarine",,
,"Peach, Apricot, and Nectarine",,
,Papaya,Anthracnose ,"(fungus – ,): The initial symptoms are watersoaked, sunken spots one-quarter to one inch in diameter on fruit (,). The centers of these spots later turn black and then pink when the fungus produces spores. The flesh beneath the spots becomes soft and watery, which spreads to the entire fruit. Small, irregular-shaped watersoaked spots on leaves may also be seen. These spots eventually turn brown. In the climate of south Texas, cultural control measures should be sufficient for control of this disease in the home garden. These measures include removing the fruit as soon as it matures, removing all dead leaves and fruit from the vicinity of the plants, and removing infected fruits from the trees. Under conditions of severe disease pressure that would be found in more rainy, humid climates, fungicides may be used."
,Papaya,Black Spot," (fungus – ,): The initial symptoms are water-soaked spots on the upper leaf surface. Later, small, black spots are visible on the underside of the leaf (,). Black spots may also be found on the fruit. The tissue beneath them becomes corky, but the fruit does not rot. If there is a high incidence of infection of young leaves, a fungicide may be used."
,Papaya,Collapse of Mature Plants," (unknown cause): This disease has been reported in the Rio Grande Valley. One of the symptoms is a sudden weakening of petioles that causes the leaves to droop close to the stem. The roots or stems of such plants often show a watery brown rot and the plants eventually die. The cause has not been determined, but fungi such as ,and ,have been isolated from roots. The disease has been associated with waterlogged soil and poor soil drainage."
,Papaya,Damping-Off," (fungus – ,): This is a disease of young seedlings. Lesions are seen on the stem at or just above soil level. The stem becomes watery and shrinks, followed by death of the plant. Use well-drained soil and avoid overwatering."
,Papaya,Herbicide Injury,": Curling of the leaves was seen with the use of a hormonal herbicide (2,4-D) applied to a nearby lawn (,). Herbicides may drift with the wind from the area of application to nearby susceptible plants. Additionally, ester formulations of 2,4-D may volatilize (i.e. become a vapor after they are applied) and move to non-treated areas. Herbicide injuries of this type are not likely to cause permanent damage to trees."
,Papaya,Stem Rot," (fungus – ,sp.): This disease was seen on young transplants. The initial symptom is a watersoaking of the lower stem followed by its disintegration. Plants eventually wilt. Often, the white, cottony growth of the fungus is visible (,). Transplants should be planted in soil with good drainage. Stems should not be banked with soil."
,Papaya,,
,Mayhaw,Brown Rot," (fungus – ,sp.): Only the blossom blight phase of brown rot has been observed in Texas and it is of minor importance. Brown rot may become more prevalent as mayhaws are commercialized."
,Mayhaw,Cedar-Quince Rust," (fungus – ,): Cedar- Quince Rust is the most destructive disease on mayhaw. Infection takes place in spring. Fungal spores for infection on mayhaw come from orange jelly-like growths on cedar limbs – Eastern red cedar primarily (,). These spores are windblown from up to a mile away, indicating the alternate host for cedar-quince rust does not have to be in close proximity. Mayhaw fruit is more susceptible than young twigs. Leaves are seldom infected. After colonizing fruit the fungus erupts through the epidermis forming tubular orange structures full of spores (,) that can only infect cedar or some similar alternate host. Infectious cankers on cedar are perennial. Therefore, yearly re-infection of cedar is not necessary to keep the disease active. Heavily infected mayhaw fruit does not ripen properly and is of no value. Fungicide protection up to four weeks after bloom or until fungal eruptions on cedar cease is essential for control. Fungicides are being developed but are not currently available."
,Mayhaw,Fire Blight," (bacterium – ,): The bacterium is spread by wind, rain and insects during bloom. Infected blooms die. Invading bacteria progress into tender shoots causing a shoot blight. The bacterium becomes inactive in hot weather. This is a spring and early summer disease that is generally not encountered every year. (,)"
,Mango,Sunburn ,"(physiological): The surface of a portion of the fruit is dried and slightly sunken, but firm (,). This is an injury that can result from heating when water or sprayed material on the fruit surface concentrates sunlight (the “lens effect”)."
,Mango,Tipburn ,"(physiological): The leaves are necrotic around the edges (,). A moisture deficiency or salt accumulation can cause the damage. Extreme fluctuations in soil moisture should be avoided. Plants may need a heavy watering to flush salts out of the root zone. This may require an improvement in soil drainage."

,Citrus Diseases,Alternaria Stem-End Rot (Black Rot),"Cracks in the stylar end of the fruit, or the bellybutton of the fruit, allow the fungus to enter and infect the fruit. Infected fruit will change color prematurely and may drop early from the tree. ,A light brown to black spot on the rind can be noticed near the stylar end of the fruit and when the it is sliced open one can observe the black rot inside the fruit."
,Citrus Diseases,Cachexia (Xyloporosis),When the bark is peeled back one can observe smooth depressions in the wood which correspond to projections extending from the inner bark. 
,Citrus Diseases,Citrus Greening (Huanglongbing),"Infected trees may decline and eventually die. Fruit maybe small and lopsided. ,Irregular patterns of dark green, light green and yellow blotches (mottling) cross the veins of leaves and are asymmetrically displayed on the leaf blade. Infected leaves may be thicker and leathery compared to healthy leaves."
,Citrus Diseases,Citrus Tatter Leaf,"Infected plants are usually symptomless. However, when symptoms are produced, one can observe leaf yellowing, leaf deformation, twig deformation, stunting, overblooming, and premature fruit drop. This virus also causes a bud-union crease, which can be seen when the bark is peeled back. One can observe a yellow to brown line where the scion and stock were grafted together. "
,Citrus Diseases,Cotton Root Rot,"Infected plants die suddenly. Root bark is decayed and brownish, and bronze colored wooly strands of the fungus are frequently apparent on the root surface. Leaves will turn brown and remain attached to the branches. "
,Citrus Diseases,Diplodia Stem-End Rot,"This disease remains dormant while the fruit is still attached to the tree. Once the fruit is removed and put into storage, symptoms will be produced. The rind will first turn brown near the stem end of the fruit and then will progress down the fruit forming brown, finger-like streaks. The whole fruit will eventually turn black and give off a sour, fermented odor."
,Citrus Diseases,Exocortis,"Infected rootstocks will be stunted and the bark at the crown of the tree will peel off, this is known as bark shelling. A gummy substance may also exude from the base of the trunk."
,Citrus Diseases,Flyspeck,"Small black dots form on the rind near the oil glands. This causes the affected area to remain green when the fruit matures, or turns yellow. This does not affect the fruit or juice quality, only the fruit grade."
,Citrus Diseases,Green Mold,"Fruit injured during harvesting and handling may be infected by this fungus. The fungus enters the fruit only through wounds in the rind and these wounds soon turn to water soaked lesions. A white substance eventually forms on the lesion and as the lesion gets larger, the center will turn olive green and be outlined in white."
,Citrus Diseases,Greasy Spot,"Yellow to dark brown to black spots form on the underside of the leaf. As these spots darken, corresponding yellow spots will form on the upper leaf surface. Leaves may drop prematurely. If the fruit is infected, small black spots will form on the rind and the surrounding area will remain green longer."
,Citrus Diseases,Heart Rot/Wood Rot,"At the base of infected trunks, brown to reddish-brown, fan-shaped structures can be observed. ,This infection causes internal wood rot and the affected tree will eventually decline or die."
,Citrus Diseases,Citrus Leafminer,"Females lay larvae singly on the underside of the leaf. After the larvae hatch they begin to feed in shallow, serpent-like tunnels in the leaves. The tunnels are filled with frass, or excrement. Affected leaves will curl and be distorted."
,Citrus Diseases,Melanose,"Small, brown spots surrounded by a yellow halo form on the leaf surface. As the disease progresses, a gummy substance exudes from the spot, dries, hardens, and gives the leaf a sandpaper texture.,Leaves may drop prematurely. ,Small, brown to black raised spots form on the fruit surface. If these spots coalesce they form an irregular, cracked pattern known as “mudcake melanose.” Sometimes these spots develop in a tear-streaked pattern known as “tear-stain melanose.”"
,Citrus Diseases,Physiological Disorders," wind desiccation, Magnesium, iron or zinc deficiencies and herbicide injury., Peel oil is released when rind cells have been injured as a result of abrasion or rough handling. Sunken spots form on the rind., The fruit has a dry, brown sunken spot. , When the undersides of leaves are exposed to direct sunlight, irregular, brown, raised spots may be observed., This damage occurs as the result of twigs or leaves rubbing against young fruit"
,Citrus Diseases,Phytophthora Diseases," The low-hanging fruit become infected first and then water will disseminate the fungus to fruit higher in the tree. Light brown lesions will form on the rind. As the disease progresses, in humid conditions, a white velvety growth can be observed on the rind and the fruit will give off a pungent, rancid odor., The fungus infects the cortex of feeder roots, giving the root system a stringy appearance. This can lead to yield loss and a general prolonged tree decline., Infection of the trunk results in a dark, water-soaked areas, often with profuse exudation of a dark resin from the lesion. The dead bark frequently sloughs off the wood in vertical strips. If the lesion encircles the trunk, girdling occurs, leading to the death of the tree. "
,Citrus Diseases,Rio Grande Gummosis,"Blisters on the trunk exude a pale yellow, gummy substance. The wood beneath infected tissue is pink to orange in color. Gum pockets may form."
,Citrus Diseases,Citrus Rust Mite (Silver Mite),Mites feed on the fruit destroying the rind cells. When the fruit is green destroyed cells turn black (“bronzing”) and when the fruit is mature destroyed cells turn rust brown and are rough to the touch (“sharkskin”).
,Citrus Diseases,Psorosis (Scaly Bark),"Leaves may exhibit yellow irregular flecks, blotches or round spots. Fruit may exhibit a yellow ring shaped pattern on the rind. Trunk and limbs will exhibit bark scaling or flaking, where the bark sloughs off. A gummy substance may form around the bark lesions, impregnating the wood, eventually leading to the rapid decline of the tree. The tree will become unproductive."
,Citrus Diseases,Slow Decline,"The nematode feeds on the roots causing aboveground symptoms: canopy thinning, lack of vigor, poor fruit production, small leaf and fruit size, and exposure of bare crown limbs."
,Citrus Diseases,Sooty Mold,"Leaves, fruit and sometimes branches have a black, moldy appearance. The fungi causing sooty mold do not actually infect the plant, instead they grow on the sugary exudates (honeydew) of insects such as aphids, brown soft scale, blackflies and whiteflies. This can cause premature leaf drop and stunting of the tree."
,Citrus Diseases,Sweet Orange Scab (SOS),"Tan to gray, corky, wart-like scabs will form on the fruit rind."
,Citrus Diseases,Tristeza (Quick Decline),"The symptoms produced depend on the variety of plant, environmental conditions, and the virus strain. The virus can cause the tree to decline, leading to tree death. There are three distinct syndromes of the disease: quick decline, stem pitting, and seedling yellows. Leaves will exhibit yellow flecking, leaf cupping, and light green to yellow leaf veins. Fruit quality and size will be reduced. Branches and trunks will exhibit pitting, and if it is serious they will take on a ropey appearance."
,Citrus Diseases,Twig Dieback,"Fungal infection often occurs following a freeze or mechanical or chemical injury. Affected young branches die back from the tip, sometimes producing gum exudation. Wood discoloration under the bark maybe observed."
,Loquat,Cotton Root Rot:, See Section on

,Loquat,Root Knot Nematodes:, See Section on 
,Grape,Anthracnose ,"(fungus – ,): This disease is often called “birds-eye-rot” because of the circular, sunken, ashy gray, dark-bordered spots on the berries. It attacks fruit stems, leaf veins, petioles, tendrils, and young shoots in addition to the berries. The berry often cracks to the extent of exposing the seed. The disease overwinters in old lesions. Periods of high humidity favor disease development. Fungicides used for black rot will help prevent this problem."
,Grape,Black Rot," (fungus – ,): Black rot shows up as small, reddish-brown spots on the upper leaf surface. In older lesions the margin is a black line while the inner area of the spot is brown. Small, black dots are also visible in the center of the lesion. Infected fruit shrink until they are dried mummies. The first stage of development on the fruit is small, light-colored lesions with black borders. In advanced stages the fruit is marked with the small, black dots just like the foliage. Young grape foliage is most susceptible to this disease. Disease development is favored by high temperatures and humidity. A rainy period followed by two to three days of foggy weather favors development of this disease. Preventative fungicides along with resistant varieties should be used to control black rot."
,Grape,Cotton Root Rot: ,See section on 
,Grape,Chlorosis: ,"Chlorosis in grapes is usually caused by iron deficiency. American varieties are particularly prone to have this problem. The leaves turn yellow, but the veins remain green. If not remedied, chlorosis will decrease the yield, reduce sugar content of the fruit, and eventually kill the vine. Two applications of iron sulfate or iron chelate during the growing season should control chlorosis. In high pH soils, iron sulfate and some iron chelate may become tied up and unavailable to the plant. Foliar applications can be made, or a chelate especially for alkaline and calcareous soils, such as Sequestrene 138Fe, can be used."
,Grape,Crown Gall: ,See section on 
,Grape,Dead Arm," (fungus – ,): This fungus invades grape tissue slowly. Spring symptoms on developing shoots and leaves adjacent to an infected pruning stub may not appear for four to five years. Cankers form on vines, and nearby leaves become chlorotic and dwarfed. Cordons die later, producing the “dead arm” symptom."
,Grape,Downy Mildew," (fungus – ,): Downy mildew is common in cool, humid environments but seldom occurs in hot, dry areas. Downy mildew is first observed as a pale yellow area on the upper surface of the leaf. The underside of the leaf is marked by a downy appearance. As the disease advances the infected tissue dies and turns brown. Young stems become thickened and are often covered with the white fruiting structures. Fruit that is infected is covered with the white growth or it turns the berry a dull green and then brown. Downy mildew is a particular problem in areas of high humidity. The disease develops in temperatures of 50oF to 60oF. Some American grape varieties show resistance, but additional chemical protection is usually needed. Most European varieties are very susceptible. Fungicide application should begin before bloom and continue at seven day intervals."
,Grape,Grapevine Fanleaf ,"(virus): Fanleaf is caused by a virus that also causes yellow mosaic and veinbanding. All three are transmitted by the nematode ,. Leaf symptoms that resemble a fan are very conspicuous on Mission and French Colombard. Infected vines have shortened and more irregular internodes. Lateral sprout development, double nodes, and stem faciations cause a bushy appearance. Many berries shatter, and others do not develop beyond shot size. Diseased vines should be removed."
,Grape,Leaf Roll," (virus): Leaves roll downward and turn red between the veins progressing toward the cane tips. In California, symptoms appear in early June in non-irrigated vineyards and in August in irrigated vineyards. Vines have fewer, smaller clusters per vine with berries that are low in sugar. Red fruit varieties, such as cardinal and Mission, develop fruit lacking color, and berries of white grapes, such as Thompson seedless and Reisling, develop a yellowish-white color instead of the normal greenish-white. In general, leaf roll decreases fruit color, raises the acidity, and delays ripening. The disease is spread by propagation from infected mother vines."
,Grape,Mushroom Root Rot:, See section on 
,Grape,Pierce’s Disease," (bacterium – rickettsia-like): Early summer symptoms include delayed shoot growth, leaf mottling, and dwarfing of new shoots. Late summer and fall symptoms are burning, scalding, or drying of leaves; wilting or premature coloring of fruit; and uneven cane maturity. Ribier is very susceptible, usually dying within two years. Thompson seedless and most other French (Vinifera) varieties die within two to five years. American (Lambrusca) varieties often live longer than five years. No effective control is known. Pierce’s disease is spread by several types of leafhoppers, by the spittlebug, and by grafting. Seventy-three plant species serve as disease reservoirs and hosts for these vectors."
,Grape,Powdery Mildew," (fungus – ,): This fungus grows on all above ground parts of the vine. Powdery mildew causes curling and withering of young leaves and dark staining on the surface of mature leaves. It may appear as a gray powdery growth on canes, and when rubbed off, it leaves web-like, dark-brown discolorations. Other symptoms include dropping, discoloration or splitting of berries, browning, and poor maturation of canes. American grape varieties are rarely damaged by this disease. Since the fungus is favored by low humidity and can grow at 90oF, this disease is more common in West Texas. Prevention is the best means to control powdery mildew. It should be controlled by fungicides applied when foliage first develops and repeated at two to three week intervals until berries are full size. If newer fungicides are not available, sulfur dust applied at the rate of 5 to 10 pounds of dusting sulfur per acre will prevent powdery mildew from developing. Apply dust when shoots average 6, 12, and 18 inches in length. Make additional applications every two weeks until fruit matures. Reapply sulfur after rains. If early sprays are omitted, heavy infections can be controlled with wettable sulfur at 1.5 pounds/100 gallons with a wetting agent. Do not spray table grapes with this mixture if berries are more than one-third full size. Sulfur dust or spray can burn leaves, shoots, and fruit when the temperature is over 90oF; no applications should be made at such times."
,Grape,Root Knot Nematodes:, See section on 
,Grape,Vein Clearing, (virus): Yellowing along the leaf veins.
,Fig,Anthracnose ,"(fungus – ,): The fungus which causes anthracnose attacks both the fruit and the foliage. Infected fruit are characterized by a soft rot and premature dropping of the fruit. Immature fruit are dried up and may remain on the tree. Infection results in a small, sunken, discolored area. The areas enlarge with age and become covered with a pink mass of spores. Affected leaves will have a dark brown margin. Defoliation occurs with increased infection. Sanitation is extremely important in the fig planting. Diseased fruit as well as infected leaves should be removed."
,Fig,Cotton Root Rot: ,"(See Section on ,)"
,Fig,Crown Gall:," (See Section on ,)"
,Fig,Dieback ,"(physiological – cold injury): Fig trees are often injured by early or late frosts that kill younger twigs. Although their death is not related directly to loss in production, they may serve as a site for secondary fungi to get started. All dead twigs and limbs should be pruned from the trees."
,Fig,Fig Mosaic," (virus): Affected figs show large yellow areas in the leaves, oak leaf pattern, ring spot area, or a mild mottled pattern. Leaves may be smaller than normal and deformed. Premature defoliation and fruit drop often occur. The virus is spread by vegetative cuttings and , (eriophyid mite). Control is by selection of clean propagating stock and insect control."
,Fig,Fig Rust ,"(fungus – ,): The disease is first evident as small, angular, yellow-green flecks on the leaf. The spots do not become extremely large but do become more yellow and finally a yellowish-brown. The margin of the spot is reddish in color. On the upper surface the spots are smooth, while on the lower surface the spots appear as small blisters. Brown spores are released from the blisters at maturity. As infection continues, the leaves become more yellow, and finally they begin to die around the leaf margins. Eventually death and defoliation occur. Complete defoliation can occur in two or three weeks. Fig rust generally becomes a problem as the fruit reaches maturity. Therefore, fungicide applications should be started in the early spring when the first leaves are completely grown. Make additional applications as new growth is formed. Do not spray when the fruit is one-fourth inch in diameter as the spray residue will make the fruit unattractive. Resume spraying after the fruit has been harvested."
,Fig,Fruit Drop," (physiological – flower development): The fig produces four types of flowers (male, female, Gall, and Mule): The male and female flowers are most often associated with the Capri type fig. This fig requires a wasp for pollination. The wasp does not occur in this part of the United States, thus it is impossible to grow Capri figs in Texas. Gall flowers are imperfect female flowers. They are found only on Capri and Cordelia figs. Mule flowers need no pollination and produce no seeds. The common fig grown in Texas produces primarily mule flowers. Since no seed are formed, the mule flowers are more subject to dropping than than those flowers which require pollination. The presence of the seed and the growth hormones produced by the seed help prevent fruit drop. The figs grown in Texas due to absence of seed are more subject to premature fruit drop as a result of adverse growing conditions."
,Fig,Leaf Blight," (fungus – ,): In early stages of infection, small areas in the leaves become yellow and appear watersoaked. With continual development, the upper surface becomes silvery white, and the lower surface becomes light brown and covered with a thin fungal web. In most cases, the leaves will turn brown and shrivel. It affects primarily the leaves but may develop on some fruit if it is new and a severely affected leaf or stem tip. Sanitation is the only recommendation to reduce losses from this disease."
,Fig,Limb Blight," (fungus – ,): Affected limbs wilt rapidly. The fungus enters at a spot along the main or secondary limbs, and all leaves die beyond that point. The fungus enters at a dead fruiting spore or at some other injured spot. All dead twigs and limbs should be removed by pruning so that they will not serve as infection sites."

,Fig,Root Knot Nematodes," (nematode – ,spp.): Root knot is one of the most common disease problems occurring on figs. Infected roots are characterized by small galls or swellings on the roots. The presence of the galls on the roots interferes with the normal uptake of nutrients by the roots. Plants infested with root knot are stunted and have a general unhealthy appearance. Infested planting sites should be treated with Vapam prior to planting. This will reduce the nematodes in the soil to a low level. Do not use around living plants as it will result in severe root pruning, and in many cases death will occur. Make sure the fig plant is free of root knot. Once planted, the only practice left is to keep the plant in good health with regular fertilizer applications and maintain adequate moisture around the plant. If nematodes were initially present, the fig will eventually become infested, but the root system should be well established by then. (See Section on ,)"
,Fig,Sclerotium Blight ,"(fungus – ,): A yellowish-white mat of fungal growth is formed at the base of the plant. Round, hard, yellowish to brown bodies (sclerotia) are found scattered in the fungal growth. To prevent the occurrence of this disease, it is important to carry out a thorough sanitation program. Old leaves or grass around the base of tree will encourage fungal development."
,Fig,Souring ,"(several fungi and bacteria): Organisms are carried into the fruit by the dried fruit beetle. Figs which have open “eyes” or ostioles should not be planted. Only those with closed “eyes” should be planted. Some examples of closed eye figs are Celest, Texas Everbearing, and Alma. No chemical control has been found to be totally effective. Maneb fungicide will help to some extent. Insects should be controlled to eliminate them as carriers for the disease causing organisms."

,Common Sweet Cherry,Leafspot ,"(fungus – ,): This is the most common and most damaging leaf disease of cherries. It is most prevalent during rainy springs. The reddish spots drop out leaving circular holes in the leaves (,). With severe infection, defoliation may follow the appearance of the “shot hole” symptom. This disease can be controlled with foliar fungicides. (,)"
,Common Sweet Cherry,Shot-hole or Black Leaf spot," (bacterium – ,): This bacterium also attacks peach and plum. The infected tissue dries up and falls out leaving a one-eighth inch diameter hole. It also causes a canker and gummosis of the stem. (,)"
,Common Sweet Cherry,Rust ,"(fungus – ,): Rust also occurs on peach and plum. Yellow spots appear on the upper leaf surface with reddish pustules filled with spores on the lower surface. It can cause premature leaf drop lowering tree vigor. Apply fungicides in late summer and fall."
,Common Sweet Cherry,Bacterial Canker," (bacterium – ,): This bacterium causes cankers, gummosis, and shoot blight (,). Sunken lesions appear in the spring with gummosis. Cracks and cankering follow, resulting in a girdled stem. The foliage becomes yellow, curled, and withered. Wet spring weather can result in shoot blight and a small angular leafspot (,). This is usually only a problem in young orchards. Use resistant F12-1 Mazzard rootstock. Remove girdled branches. Spray with copper hydroxide in October and January. This bacterium also attacks peaches. (,)"
,Common Sweet Cherry,Crown Gall," (bacterium – ,): Warty tissue masses or galls may form on the roots, at the root collar, or anywhere on the stem. No practical controls are available. See section on Crown Gall for more detail."
,Common Sweet Cherry,Black Knot," (fungus – ,): Black knot is a very conspicuous and common disease that is also found on apricots and plums. Large, rough black galls form on the twigs (,). Twigs may die beyond the galls. No chemical control is recommended. Infected limbs should be removed."
,Common Sweet Cherry,Brown Rot," (fungus – , and ,): These fungi cause blossom blight, twig blight, and fruit rot. See the section on Peaches – Brown Rot for more detail. Control by fungicide application and sanitation. (,)"
,Common Sweet Cherry,Witches’ Broom," (fungus – ,): This fungus causes large numbers of irregular small branches to develop on twigs and larger branches forming a witches’ broom. Blossoms develop and the leaves come out on the brooms earlier than on the normal branches. Large numbers of brooms may eventually kill a tree. Cut and burn brooms."

,Common Sweet Cherry,Littleleaf:, This is a condition in the West caused by a lack of zinc.
,Common Sweet Cherry,Little Cherry, (virus): Fruit are half size. Flowering cherry acts as a reservoir for the virus. Buy only virus-free trees from reputable nurserymen and remove infected trees when they are discovered.
,Common Sweet Cherry,Necrotic Rusty Mottle ,"(virus): Foliage and blossoms are delayed in the spring. Brown necrotic or rusty chlorotic spots develop on the leaves, often falling out to leave shot holes (See Photo). Defoliation may occur. Buy virus-free trees from reputable nurserymen. Virus infected trees should be removed from the orchard."
,Common Sweet Cherry,Rugose Mosaic, (virus): General chlorosis of the leaf occurs between mid vein and margin with distortion. Fruit yield is reduced. The fruits become flattened and angular. Remove infected trees.
,Common Sweet Cherry,Rusty Mottle ,"(virus): Many leaves turn bright yellow to red with green islands and drop before harvest. Those that remain have yellow-brown spots with a rusty appearance. The fruit is small, late, and tasteless. Remove diseased trees and select grafting material from virus-free trees."
,Common Sweet Cherry,Vein Clearing or Sweet Cherry Crinkle," (probably genetic): A non-transmissible virus-like disease. Veins clear in localized areas or the entire leaf Margins of the leaves are irregular. Some are elongated with slot-like perforations. Small blisters appear on lower sides of veins, and the upper sides are silvery. Leaves fold along midrib, wilt, and drop in midsummer. Some branches will rosette. Flowers are plentiful, but few will develop into fruit. The fruit will be pointed and flattened on one side with a swollen ridge."
,Common Sweet Cherry,,
,Blueberry,Botrytis Blight," (fungus – ,): Under high humidity and mild temperatures this fungus can attack blooms and tender growth. Blossoms may shrivel prematurely as if injured by frost. The fungus grows profusely, producing a gray to brownish fuzzy material on infected parts. Rarely is Botrytis a serious problem, but when it occurs, heavy losses can result. Botrytis can also cause post harvest fruit rot. [,]"
,Blueberry,Leaf Spot," (fungus – ,): Leaf spot diseases develop on occasion but are considered minor problems in production plantings. Fungicide treatments are not generally recommended."
,Blueberry,Mummy Berry," (fungus – ,): The fungus infects when growth begins in spring, causing a leaf and flower blight (,). It might be confused with Botrytis blight at this stage. Blighted leaves and blossoms quickly develop a light brown fungal growth on external surfaces as they dieback (,). Some infected blossoms continue development without noticeable symptoms. As these fruit approach maturity, they turn a pink to white color instead of blue (,). By this time the fungus has colonized the fruit, forming hard, black, survival structures inside that remain dormant until the following spring (,). Mummy berry disease is not common, but when it occurs, there can be heavy losses, especially during bloom. Preventive fungicide treatments are recommended for control [,]."
,Blueberry,Stem Blight ,"(fungus – ,): Leaves yellow and infected branches die. Rarely is the entire plant lost. Prune out diseased wood. Fungicides have not proven beneficial."
,Blueberry,Stem Canker," (fungus – ,): Although susceptible, most rabbiteye varieties have some degree of resistance to stem canker. Like stem blight, stem canker eventually causes branch dieback. Prune out affected wood. Fungicides are not effective."

,"Blackberry, Dewberry, and Boysenberry",Algal Spot," (alga, ,sp.): Light green to light orange spots develop on canes. Spots can merge to cover entire portions of canes. This disease has not been studied in detail, especially relating to overall damage. Copper type fungicides are recommended for control. (See Photo of ,)"
,"Blackberry, Dewberry, and Boysenberry",Anthracnose ,"(fungus – ,): A common cane and foliage disease of blackberry and dewberry sometimes called dieback. The disease first appears in the spring as small purplish spots on new shoots and purple bordered spots on leaves. Spots on canes enlarge, usually develop an oval shape, and gradually turn gray. Ends of badly infected canes die back. Erect types are less susceptible than the more spreading types. Late dormant fungicide application will help prevent infection. (See Photo of ,)"
,"Blackberry, Dewberry, and Boysenberry",Cane and Leaf Rust," (fungus – ,): Small, lemon-yellow pustules develop on canes and leaves throughout summer. Cracking and drying of canes and spotting and drying of leaves result. The disease is not systemic and does not affect blooming. Prune out and burn infected canes. It is a minor fungal disease. (See Photo of ,)"
,"Blackberry, Dewberry, and Boysenberry",Fruit rots," (fungi – ,sp., ,sp.): Mild, wet weather conditions are ideal for fruit rot fungi. Overripe fruit is most susceptible. Timely harvest and spacing plants for good air circulation help prevent fruit rots. Fungicides are available but should not be overused due to resistance development in the fungal populations."
,"Blackberry, Dewberry, and Boysenberry","Cane Gall, Crown Gall, and Hairy Root"," (bacteria – ,): Cane galls are large, bark splitting swellings in long masses. Crown gall consists of large warty galls on roots or at base of canes. Where hairy root is involved, small wiry roots grow singly or in bunches from the main root or base of stem. Remove and destroy affected plants. Avoid replanting where diseased plants were removed. Examine nursery stock for evidence of galls and hairy root. Do not plant stock with galls or plants that have had galls removed."
,"Blackberry, Dewberry, and Boysenberry",Nematodes Other Than Root Knot," (,spp and others): Xiphinema or dagger nematode damage results in root swelling especially at the tips. Symptoms can be confused with root knot nematode damage as seen on other crops. Dwarfed fruiting canes and smaller fruit result. Damage is more severe on light sandy soil. Severe nematode damage can be avoided by planting clean root cuttings in soil where only grasses or small grains have been allowed to grow for three to four years. Commercial producers in problem areas may need to consider a pre-plant fumigant. Root knot nematode is not a problem on caneberries. See Section on ,. (See Photo of ,)"
,"Blackberry, Dewberry, and Boysenberry",Orange Rust," (fungus – , or ,): Symptoms first appear as small, yellow spots on both sides of leaves. These spots enlarge on the underside to form irregular shaped pustules that rupture to release masses of orange spores. The fungus becomes systemic in plants, and affected plants never recover. No fruit is produced. Diseased plants, including all roots, should be removed and burned when first noticed and before pustules break open. Control weed growth and remove fruiting canes after harvest to improve air circulation. Destroy wild brambles and dewberries in adjacent areas. Fungicides are not effective against this rust. Varieties vary in their susceptibility to this fungus. Most thorn type blackberries are resistant. (See Photo of ,)"
,"Blackberry, Dewberry, and Boysenberry",Rosette ,"(fungus – ,): This disease is also called double blossom or witches’ broom. Symptoms appear in the spring as bunches or clusters of foliage at terminals or along fruiting canes. Flower buds are larger and redder than normal. Petals may be purplish, and sepals are much elongated. Infected flowers do not set fruit. Control rosette by removing infected canes as soon as they become noticeable. Destroy all wild berry plants in the vicinity. Remove and burn all fruiting canes soon after harvest and keep plants adequately spaced for good air circulation. Where heavy infection has occurred, mowing all canes to the ground may be necessary. The new thornless blackberry varieties, Navaho and A. (See , and , of Rosette)"
,"Blackberry, Dewberry, and Boysenberry",Septoria Leafspot," (fungus – ,): A fungus disease causing symptoms similar to anthracnose leafspots. Spots tend to remain small with light brown or tan centers. Tiny black specks visible with a hand lens develop in centers of leafspots. Chemical control is not usually necessary."
,"Blackberry, Dewberry, and Boysenberry",Virus Diseases:," Viruses transmission has not been determined. Diagnosis of specific viruses is difficult based on symptoms. Viral symptoms include mosaic on foliage, stunting, leaf curl, leaf distortion and sterility or partial sterility. Poorly developed fruit, known as nubbins, may occur with normal fruit in the same cluster. See section on ,."
,"Blackberry, Dewberry, and Boysenberry",,
,Avocado,Anthracnose ,"(fungus – ,): Black circular spots up to one-half inch appear on fruit. The center of the spots may be slightly sunken and spots may develop cracks. During moist periods, the spots produce pinkish, moist masses of fungal spores. As the fruit ripens, the infection spreads rapidly into the flesh causing a greenish-black, fairly firm decay. Fungicides can control the disease and should be applied at bud swell."
,Avocado,Cotton Root Rot," (fungus – ,) : Although avocado is susceptible to cotton rot root, it is not a common disease. It is characterized by a sudden wilt of the tree. The leaves turn brown and remain on the tree. Very young trees tend to become diseased, rather than old ones. The only control is to avoid planting trees in soil known to be infested with the fungus. See Section on ,."
,Avocado,Leaf Burn," (physiological): Leaves brown at the tips and the edges. Affected leaves may drop prematurely. These symptoms can be caused by accumulation of salts in the soil, inadequate soil moisture, wind dessication, and frost. Light irrigation should be avoided since this fails to leach accumulated salts out of the root zone. The soil should have good drainage."
,Avocado,Phytophthora Root Rot," (fungus – ,): Infected trees have small leaves which are lighter green in color than healthy leaves. The leaves wilt and drop, eventually leading to complete defoliation of the tree. Twigs and branches die back. There is a light fruit set with small fruit. The fungus infects roots up to one-quarter inch in size, although it is the feeder roots that are primarily affected. These roots become blackened and brittle before they die. The disease occurs if the pathogen is present in soil and if there is excessive soil moisture. Poor drainage can be a contributing factor to disease development. The fungus can be introduced to new areas by movement of infected nursery stock or infested soil. Soil on implements can also serve as a means for introduction of the fungus to non-infested areas. Fungicides should be used in combination with sanitation in the nursery and maintaining adequate drainage in the field."
,Avocado,Scab ,"(fungus – ,): Circular, brown, scabby areas are found on mature fruit (,). Leaves have brown spots and become crinkled. The disease can become a problem if there is cool, moist weather when fruit and leaf tissue is young. Fungicides can control the disease and should be applied when flower buds appear, near the end of the main bloom period, and 3-4 weeks after that."
,Avocado,Seedling Blight," (fungi – ,spp.): This can be an important disease in nursery production. Leaves show irregular reddish-brown areas that enlarge along the larger veins. The terminal bud may be killed. The disease is favored by periods of heavy rainfall and high humidity, when seedlings are young and succulent. The following cultural practices can prevent or minimize damage. Plants should be grown on benches. The use of soil should be avoided to prevent introduction of the pathogen. Irrigation water from ponds may also serve as a pathogen source. Providing good air circulation between plants will provide a less-favorable microclimate for disease development. Fungicides should be used only in combination with cultural control practices. See section on ,."
,Avocado,Sunblotch ,"(avocado sunblotch viroid): Twigs have a light yellow, sunken streak that follow the length of the twig. Fruits have white or yellow areas. Trees are stunted and have a sprawling growth habit. The pathogen is transmitted in budwood, graftwood, or seed from infected trees. Disease-free nursery stock should be used and trees with symptoms should be removed from the orchard."
,Avocado,Wood Rot," (fungus – ,): This fungus contributed to the gradual decline and death of trees in a portion of an orchard in the Rio Grande Valley. The decline occurred over a period of several months during the summer. The leaves of affected trees first turned pale to yellow and trees soon lost leaves (,). Eventually, trees were completely defoliated and died (,). Fruiting bodies of the fungus were found on dead and dying trees (,). The above-ground symptoms of the disease resemble Phytophthora root rot. The disease occurred in a portion of the orchard with poor drainage that was subject to waterlogging. The waterlogging led to the death of feeder roots (again, a symptom that resembles Phytophthora root rot) and stressed the trees. This environmental stress allowed the fungus to develop within trees. The fungus infected the trees via wind-blown spores that entered the tree through wounds. There is no chemical control for this pathogen. Encouraging vigorous tree growth by minimizing environmental stresses (e.g. improving soil drainage) will prevent establishment of the fungus in the tree."
,Avocado,,
,Apple,Apple Blotch," (fungus – ,): Shiny, black blotches develop on fruit. Edges of lesions are irregular with radiating outgrowths. Foliage symptoms are characterized by light gray spots with a dark dot in the center. Elongated, sunken, light colored lesions with black dots are formed on veins, midribs and petioles of the leaves. The spread of blotch is favored by temperatures of 75oF to 80oF and heavy rains. Several fungicides will control this disease."
,Apple,Bitter Rot ,"(fungus – ,): Symptoms appear first as small, circular, brown spots on both apples and pears. The lesion enlarges and becomes saucer-shaped. The fungus overwinters in mummified fruit and cracks or crevices in bark. Most infections can be traced to a broken limb. Infection normally shows up in mid to late summer. Young fruit are resistant to the fungus. Maximum infection occurs at 85oF and after light rain. Orchard sanitation and a regular spray program are extremely important. Broken limbs should be cut to prevent overwintering of spores in these protected areas."
,Apple,Black Rot," (fungus – ,): Black rot is a firm, textured rot. The spot is light brown and darkens with age. As it enlarges, it is marked with concentric dark bands. The lesion is convex in shape, yet in very advanced stages becomes somewhat depressed. On the leaf the lesion is a purple speck that enlarges and eventually has a center which is brown or yellowish-brown. The fungus infects foliage at petal fall. Fruit infection is not normally evident until midsummer. The disease is favored by temperatures of 80oF and light rain. Although fungicides help, sanitation is the best means of reducing this disease."
,Apple,Bot Rot," (fungus – ,): The fungus infects woody tissues and fruits. Wounded apple wood is very susceptible. On limbs and twigs, infection is visible in July. It appears as a blister on the infected limbs. At maturity the blister ruptures and a liquid spreads over the limbs. The wet area then becomes sunken with a dark colored appearance. The spot spreads into the cambium where it enlarges in concentric rings until fall. Lesions stop enlarging in the fall and cracks appear along the edge of the spot. It may or may not begin growth next spring. Fruit infection is observed as small reddish-brown spots. These eventually coalesce, causing a soft rot to occur. As the decay develops, the lesion turns light brown to dark brown and is covered with beads of exudate on the surface of the decayed fruit. The fungus overwinters in live and dead limbs. In the spring, an ooze is formed which is spread over the tree. Mature and ripened fruit are very susceptible. The disease develops at temperatures of 75oF or above.  Botryosphaeria infection is encouraged by any condition which reduces tree vigor such as drought, winter injury, and low nutrition. Jagged pruning wounds and grafting sites are sometimes invaded. Pruning out the decayed areas and a thorough spray program will significantly reduce losses to this disease."
,Apple,Cedar Apple Rust," (fungus – ,): The fungus passes part of its life on apple and part on the cedar. On cedar it forms reddish galls which swell and produce an orange slime each spring. On apple it causes spots on leaves, fruit and sometimes on young twigs. The spots on the foliage and fruit are orange-yellow in color, and a blister or cushion forms in the center of each spot. Where this disease is a problem, cedars should be destroyed for 1 mile around an apple orchard. Normal spray programs will control infection on apples. Resistant varieties should be used when available. Golden Delicious and Delicious are resistant. Most ornamental Crabapples and Jonathans are susceptible."
,Apple,Chlorosis:, (See iron deficiency)
,Apple,Cotton Root Rot," (fungus – ,): Apples should never be planted in soil infected with this fungus due to its extreme susceptibility. See the separate section on , for more information."
,Apple,Crown Gall:," (See section on  ,)"
,Apple,Fire Blight," (bacterium – ,): This bacterium causes twig dieback and is common on apples and pears as well as some 75 other plant species. Blossom blight is common on apples. Infected blossoms wilt and turn black rapidly. The foliage does not immediately abscise due to the rapid rate of death. Twig blight is common and can result in dieback ranging up to 12 to 36 inches of twig length. The bacteria overwinters in cankers. Bacteria oozes from the cankers in early spring and are carried by wind and insects to healthy foliage. Resistant varieties should be used when available. Fungicides containing copper will cause russetting on apples. Trees which have had fire blight should be pruned to remove overwintering cankers. Nitrogen levels should be kept low. No organic nitrogen sources should be used as they encourage continual growth which is susceptible to the bacterium. Make cuts from 4 to 6 inches below the visible cankers. All pruning equipment should be sterilized with a one part household bleach to nine parts water solution. For more information, refer to the pear section."
,Apple,Fly Speck," (fungus – ,): Numerous small, shiny, black spots are formed on the fruit. Control is the same as sooty blotch."
,Apple,Mushroom Root Rot," (fungus – ,): Mushroom root rot is caused by a soilborne fungus which attacks apples and causes a slow decline. Trees may be infected with the fungus for 2 to 3 years before death occurs. The vigor of the tree is noticeably reduced during this time. Trees infected with Armillaria mellea have a layer of creamy white fungal growth between the bark and the wood at the soil line. The growth (rhizomorphs) girdles the trunk and the tree dies when this girdling is complete. Trees damaged by the fungus can be diagnosed by the presence of the rhizomorphs and the advanced stage of decay of the root system. Infected trees are loose in the soil due to the deterioration of the root system. Mushroom root rot is most often found in areas where post oaks were the predominate native timber and in sandy soils. This does not always hold true, and growers must be aware that the disease can cause serious losses in many soil types should it become established. Soil fumigation will give only temporary control of this problem. The wide distribution of the fungus in the soil (both vertically and horizontally) and the constant recontamination of a fumigated area from non fumigated soils reduce the early advantage gained by soil fumigation. Resistant root stocks are not available. Growers should avoid planting in areas where the fungus has been a problem in the past or on recently cleared post oak timberland. It is best for a homeowner to move to another planting site should plants die from mushroom root rot. See section on ,."
,Apple,Phytophthora Collar Rot ,"(fungus – ,): Black, slimy cankers are formed from the bud union to the lower portion of the trunk. Trees infected with this fungus are stunted and eventually die. It is particularly damaging on the Malling Merton Clones. Most seedlings of Delicious, Melba, McIntosh, and Wheatly are resistant. No chemical control recommended. See section on resistant varieties."
,Apple,Powdery Mildew," (fungus – ,): Young foliage shows cupping and twisting. The leaves are covered with a white, powdery mass of spores. Net russetting will occur on fruit when it is infected with this fungus. All varieties are susceptible, yet Jonathan appears to be more susceptible than most. Use of a regular fungicide program will control this problem. Karathane, a commonly recommended fungicide, should not be used at temperatures of 90oF or above. A spreader should be used to improve control."
,Apple,,
,Apple,Scab ,"(fungus – ,): This fungus attacks both the foliage and the fruit. It first appears on the leaves as small, dull, smoky areas which with age become olive colored, velvety, and much more visible. On fruit, the lesions are first small, circular, olive green areas which turn dark and scabby. The spots crack open in late stages of development. The fungus overwinters in fallen apple leaves. The fungus produces fruiting structures in the spring. Rains cause spores to be shot into the air where they are carried to developing foliage. The spore will germinate and produce a leaf spot if moisture is present when the spore lands on the leaf. Further spread occurs from these spots to adjoining leaves of fruit. Apple scab is dependent on moisture for development."
,Apple,Sooty Blotch," (fungus – ,): Sooty-gray or cloudy blotches appear on the fruit. The fungus attacks both apples and pears in Texas. It is most severe during years that have cool, wet springs, late summer rains, and low temperatures in early fall. It is normally found in conjunction with fly speck, another disease of apples and pears. Fungcides should be applied in late spring and early summer."
,Apple,Southern Blight," (fungus – ,): Infected trees die rapidly (2 to 3 weeks) after the first visible symptoms are observed. The leaves remain attached to the tree. Creamy white to yellow rhizomorphs are formed on the outside of the roots. As the growth develops, small, dark brown sclerotia are formed among the rhizomorphs. In Texas it has been observed attacking apple trees both in the nursery and in commercial orchards. Currently, no chemicals are cleared for the control of Southern Blight on apples. Deep burial of organic material prior to planting and controlling weeds at the base of the tree will help reduce losses. , is a facultative saprophyte which grows on organic material in the soil, but under certain conditions, it can attack and parasitize healthy growing plants. Crop residue should be pulled away from the base of the apple trees."
,Watermelon,Fusarium Wilt Causal Agent," (fungus – , f.sp. ,): Initially, leaves of infected plants wilt during hotter times of the day, but eventually, the wilt becomes permanent. Initially, one or a few vines of a plant are affected, but eventually the other vines wilt and the plant dies. Other agents can cause plants to wilt. For example, anasa wilt is caused by the feeding of the squash bug. The fungus causes browning of the xylem (water-conducting tissue) of the crown and runners. Races 1 and 2 of this fungus are present in several watermelon-growing areas of Texas. Most commercial cultivars have resistance to to race 1, but not race 2. The fungus persists many years in soil and so, watermelons should not be replanted into infested soils for at least five years."
,Watermelon,Yellow Vine Causal Agent: ,"(unknown, suspected to be a bacterium): This disease is found mainly in the Cross Timbers vegetation zone in central Texas and Oklahoma, but it has been found outside of this area, specifically, in Anderson county in east Texas. The symptoms appear two weeks before harvest. There is a general yellowing of leaves and terminal leaves of the vine are turned up. Not all plants within a field initially show symptoms. Plants eventually die. These symptoms are not diagnostic for this disease. The distinctive symptom of yellow vine is a honey-brown discoloration of the phloem in lower crown and primary root of plants. The cause has not been conclusively determined, but a phloem-limited bacterium has been consistently associated with diseased plants and a deltacephaline leafhopper is thought to transmit this bacterium. Other susceptible cucurbits include squash, pumpkin, and cantaloupe. There are no control measures available for this disease, but resistance in triploid seedless watermelon (e.g. ‘Tri-X 313’) has been identified."
,Watermelon,Southern Blight Causal Agent: ,"(fungus – ,): This soilborne fungus infects the crown, resulting in wilting of foliage. The fungus also causes a fruit rot. Infection is favored in warm, moist soils. There are no control recommendations."
,Watermelon,Charcoal Rot Causal Agent:," (fungus – ,): A water-soaked lesion develops around the crown of the plant, followed by the appearance of an amber-colored ooze at the surface. This area becomes dark brown, dried and cracked. Small black fungal structures (microsclerotia) are then formed in this area. A dark ring is visible beneath the outer layer when a cross section is cut through the canker. Infected plants have yellow crown leaves and die soon after symptoms are observed. The damage is most severe when melons approach maturity. There are no effective controls for the fungus. Altering the irrigation program to prevent water stress may alleviat the problem."
,Watermelon,Monosporascus Root Rot/Vine Decline Causal Agent:," (fungus – ,): Infected plants usually do not develop symptoms until near harvest time. Infected plants wilt and eventually die. Sometimes, there is vascular browning. Brown lesions may be found on the roots, even on plants that are not wilting. Root lesions may be caused by other soilborne fungi, such as Pythium sp. and Rhizoctonia solani. This disease is primarily a problem on silt or clay soils of the Lower Rio Grande Valley. The fungus is indigenous to the soil and populations build up with continued cucurbit monoculture, particularly cantaloupe. Soil fumigation is an effective control, but is not usually economical. Soils with consistent problems should not be planted to cucurbits."
,Watermelon,Damping-Off Causal Agents: ,"(fungi – , spp.): Seedlings wilt and die. The lower stems have a watersoaked appearance. Damping-off is usually a problem of direct-seeded watermelons germinating in cool, moist soil, but Pythium aphanidermatum can rapidly kill new transplants in warm soils. A soil application of mefenoxam (Ridomil Gold) at the time of planting will prevent damping-off caused by Pythium species."
,Watermelon,Nematodes,": Nematodes can substantially reduce yield of watermelon. The affected plants are stunted and chlorotic. Root-knot nematodes can cause galling on roots, but there are no visible root symptoms with the reniform nematode. The root-knot nematode occurs primarily in sandy soils. Although nematicides can provide an economical control, a crop rotation with corn or sorghum and a weed-free fallow can reduce numbers of nematodes below damaging thresholds."
,Watermelon,Southern Blight Causal Agent:," (fungus – ,): This soilborne fungus infects the crown, resulting in wilting of foliage. The fungus also causes a fruit rot. Infection is favored in warm, moist soils. There are no control recommendations."
,Watermelon,Non-Pathogenic Causes:," Agents that can cause seedling death that resemble damping-off include the seed corn maggot and lightning damage. Wind movement of young plants on plastic mulch can cause damage to the stems, leading to wilt. This problem disappears once vines are able to anchor to something. Anasa wilt, caused by the squash bug, can be mistaken for Fusarium wilt. Watermelon growing next to brush are more prone to this problem. Herbicide injury can cause symptoms that resemble those caused by pathogenic fungi. Glyphosate can cause yellowing. Trifluralin can cause scattered wilting in a field and affected plants will also exhibit discoloration or swelling of the crown area."
,Watermelon,Bacterial Fruit Blotch Causal Agent:," (bacterium – ,): Infected seedlings initially develop water-soaking on the lower surface of cotyledons and leaves. These areas then become necrotic. The pathogen can also cause non-distinctive, necrotic leafspots on transplants. On leaves of more mature plants, the pathogen can cause large, circular brown lesions, usually near the edge of the leaf, but this is not reliable for diagnosis. The unique symptoms are: irregular, rust-colored lesions that run along leaf ribs, while on the underside of the leaf, the leaf rib is water-soaked. Leaf lesions can serve as a source of bacteria that can infect fruit. In the field, leaf lesions are often difficult to find and may be confused with lesions caused by pathogenic fungi. Where this disease has occurred, watermelons and other cucurbit crops should not be replanted in the field for at least one season, crop debris should be plowed under, and volunteer plants destroyed. Cucurbit weeds such as citron melon should also be controlled. Copper-based fungicides should be applied on a regular schedule at the time of flowering or earlier, if transplants are used."
,Watermelon,Anthracnose Causal Agent: ,"(fungus – ,): Symptoms appear first on crown leaves as small, brown-black spots usually after vines begin to “run”. These lesions are also visible on the underside of leaves. During damp weather, orange-pink masses of spores develop in centers of larger leaf spots. During dry weather the spore masses turn gray. All but the youngest leaves are infected. Lesions can coalesce, causing the leaves to die. The disease can be seed borne and symptoms can sometimes be seen on young transplants. A combination of seed treatment, crop rotation and fungicide applications are necessary for controlling this disease on susceptible varieties. Protective spray applications should be made when vines start to run and should be continued at 7 to 10 day intervals during periods of humid or rainy weather. Schedules may be lengthened to 14 days during dry weather."
,Watermelon,Gummy Stem Blight Causal Agent: ,"(fungus – ,): Early symptoms are round black, wrinkled spots on young leaves and dark sunken areas on stems. Early infection usually develops from contaminated seed and can be visible on transplants. Often, infected transplants will have lesions on the the stem. On older leaves in the field, irregular brown to black spots develop between leaf veins. Leaf lesions will expand, eventually resulting in the death of leaves. As the disease progresses, older stems near the crown, most commonly near a leaf petiole or tendril, split and a light brown gum oozes from the watersoaked areas. The crown may also be infected and produce a brown ooze. Infected runners die, leaving fruit exposed. vegetables are not usually affected. Protective fungicide applications are needed for control. Resistance to benomyl and thiophanate-methyl fungicides have occurred in some growing areas, so these fungicides are not recommended."
,Watermelon,Downy Mildew Causal Agent:," (fungus – ,): The disease is most severe during periods of cool temperatures and rain. Irregular yellowish to brown spots, often vague in outline, appear on upper leaf surface near the crown. Brown spots later become more distinct on both sides of the leaves. The underside of leaves exhibit a brown to gray fungal growth on wet mornings, which disappears during dry weather. This growth is best seen early in the morning, or, alternatively, suspect leaves can be removed and kept several hours in a plastic bag with a moist paper towel to provide high humidity that encourages sporulation. Spots enlarge rapidly and turn black and the entire leaf withers and dies. Leaf petioles of diseased leaves stand upright although the leaf is almost dead. There can be a rapid, extensive loss of foliage with this disease. The disease is favored by cool (60oF night and up to 77oF day) temperatures, along with rain or continuous high humidity. This disease can occur in a field miles away from other cucurbits, indicating that the spores can travel great distances. The fungus develops and spreads rapidly during cool, moist weather conditions. Excellent control of this disease can be achieved with mefanoxam (Ridomil Gold), which must always be used simultaneously with a protectant fungicide such as mancozeb or chlorothalonil, to prevent the emergence of resistant strains. It is important that these sprays are applied on a preventative basis, before the disease becomes established in a field. Some growers report that they only use chlorothalonil or mancozeb to effectively manage downy mildew, but, the key to their effectiveness is regular, preventative applications."
,Watermelon,Alternaria Leaf Spot Causal Agent:," (fungus – ,): Lesions are round to irregular target spots on older leaves. The symptoms are first observed at the crown of the plant. As the spots enlarge, concentric rings are formed in the lesion. The disease is favored by continuous wet conditions. The fungus is controlled with a 2 year cucurbit-free rotation, destruction of the previous crop residue and application of fungicides as needed. At the end of the growing season, plow under crop residue."
,Watermelon,Cercospora Leaf Spot Causal Agent:," (fungus – ,): Leaf spots have a dark brown center and a yellow halo. Infected leaves are first observed at the crown of the plant. When the disease is severe, foliage loss will restrict fruit development and result in sunburn of fruit. The fungus is controlled with fungicides. Applications should begin soon after runner development."
,Watermelon,Myrothecium Leaf Spot Causal Agent: ,"(fungus – ,): This fungus causes small, dark brown circular lesions on leaves. These lesions can coalesce. The disease is favored by wet weather conditions that favor the development of other foliar pathogens and can be controlled by the protectant fungicides used to control these pathogens. The disease occurs infrequently and has been observed mostly in the Lower Rio Grande Valley."
,Watermelon,Powdery Mildew Causal Agent(s):," (fungi – ,): The first symptom is a white to gray dusty material on the upper leaf surface. The fungus quickly spreads to completely cover the leaf surface. Once the leaf is covered, it dies and has a crisp texture. This disease is favored by high humidity, but not free water on leaves. The fungus is best controlled with fungicide applications when symptoms are first observed. It tends to occur on older leaves and later in the growing season, so control is not usually warranted. Two systemic fungicides, Benlate (benomyl) and Bayleton (triadimefon), are no longer effective because of pathogen resistance."
,Watermelon,Leaf Mosaic Causal Agents:," (viruses -Watermelon Mosaic Virus, Papaya Ringspot Virus, Zucchini Yellow Mosaic Virus, Cucumber Mosaic Virus):  Leaves of infected plants have a mosaic pattern, i.e., areas of light and dark coloration. This mosaic may be in association with raised areas on leaves. Leaves may also be distorted in shape. Diagnosis of the mosaic viruses can not be made with certainty from symptoms alone. Sometimes plants may be infected by more than one type of virus. Losses from virus infection are more significant if young plants are infected. Most of the young fruit is aborted and those that are not aborted are malformed. The viruses listed above are aphid-transmitted and can overwinter in weeds. Virus control by insect control is not usually feasible. Weed control in and around the field may help to reduce losses, except for virus introduction via winged aphids."
,Watermelon,Tobacco Ring Spot Virus:," Tiny brown spots surrounded by yellow halo may appear on young leaves as a “stippling” effect. Symptoms produced on vegetables are more important than leaf symptoms, though. The virus can overwinter in wild hosts and in infected seed. It is spread from infected plants by the dagger nematode (Xiphinema spp.), grasshoppers, tobacco thrips, tobacco flea beetles and several other insects."
,Watermelon,Squash Leaf Curl Virus: ,"This virus is transmitted by whiteflies and is a problem only in south Texas. Symptoms of the disease are crumpled leaves with yellowed, mottled areas. Leaves have shortened petioles that cluster around the vines. Squash is also susceptible to this virus. Severe yield losses are associated with infection of young seedlings, usually when whitefly populations are high. Infections of older plants do not affect yield. Another whitefly-transmitted virus recently identified in south Texas is the cucurbit yellow stunt disorder virus, which causes a yellowing of leaves. The squash leaf curl virus is economically important only in fall-grown watermelons. To alleviate the impact on yield, transplants should be used, rather than direct-seeded plants. Fields should be plowed under after harvest to minimize carryover of the virus to subsequent crops. The virus can persist in whiteflies for 3 weeks after feeding on infected plants, so there should be a 4 week break between melon crops."
,Watermelon,Herbicide Injury:," Growth deformation on foliage can be caused by 2,4-D or dicamba. This deformation can resemble symptoms caused by some mosaic viruses."
,Watermelon,Bacterial Fruit Blotch Causal Agent:," (bacterium – ,): Fruit symptoms start as water-soaked spots that rapidly enlarge. Symptoms are generally seen in the light portions of striped fruit [PICTURE 58]. The lesions later turn brown and crack. The pathogen is introduced to a field by planting contaminated seed or transplants. Within the field, the bacteria spread to healthy plants via rain or overhead irrigation, especially under conditions of high humidity and temperature. The fruit are most susceptible to infection around the time of pollination. As the fruit matures, it becomes resistant to infection. Once introduced into a field, the bacteria can persist on volunteer watermelon or citron plants, or in their seed. Cantaloupe and honeydew melons are also susceptible to this pathogen. Where this disease has occurred, watermelons and other cucurbit crops should not be replanted in the field for at least one season, crop debris should be plowed under, and volunteer plants destroyed. Cucurbit weeds such as citron melon should also be controlled. Copper-based fungicides should be applied on a regular schedule at the time of flowering or earlier, if transplants are used."
,Watermelon,Anthracnose Causal Agent:," (fungus – ,): The fungus produces sunken spots on the rind of fruit, that are often black because of the production of spores. Symptoms may not be visible at harvest, or they might be slight, but decay may develop further in transit or at the market. Small anthracnose spots can be confused with pimples disease."
,Watermelon,Bacterial Rind Necrosis Causal Agent:," (bacterium – ,spp.): The first symptoms are numerous brown, dry, hard, discolored areas in the rind. These areas enlarge and may merge to form extensive necrotic areas. The disease rarely extends into the flesh of infected melons in the field. The disease occurs sporadically and is thought to be caused by bacteria that are naturally present in fruit, but the reasons for symptom development are not understood. Since usually there are no external symptoms, a small percentage of diseased melons could make the crop unmarketable, as diseased melons cannot be culled. There are no control measures."
,Watermelon,Belly Rot Causal Agent(s): ,"(fungi – several species): The fruit decays at the area in contact with soil. The rot begins as a small water soaked area that quickly spreads. In many cases, the area will be surrounded by a profuse growth of white mycelium. One of the fungal species associated with belly rot is Pythium aphanidermatum, which rapidly colonizes the fruit. Another species involved is the southern blight fungus, Sclerotium rolfsii, which produces seed-like resting structures. The disease is most severe during periods of rainfall and high temperature, when the soil remains wet for long periods of time. To control, use well-drained soils, or plant on plastic mulch."
,Watermelon,Lasiodiplodia Fruit Rot / Diplodia Stem-End Rot Causal Agent:," (fungus – ,): Watersoaking is seen at the stem end and the tissue is soft. When harvesting, a large portion of the peduncle should remain attached to the fruit. The disease is of minor importance."
,Watermelon,Pimples Causal Agent:," (suspected virus – Tobacco Ring Spot Virus): Small bumps or pimples develop on fruit, which are most noticeable on dark rind varieties. Other fruit symptoms are ringspots and necrotic, concentric rings."
,Watermelon,Blossom End Rot Causal Agent:," (physiological – water stress): Browning and shriveling occur at the blossom end of melon, followed by a secondary decay caused by microorganisms that progresses inward. It is caused by a calcium deficiency in the fruit and occurs in plants subjected to drought stress. Cultivars can differ in their susceptibility to the problem. Watering operations that avoid drought stress can reduce or eliminate the problem. Excess nitrogen fertilizer may also contribute to blossom-end rot."
,Watermelon,Bottle Neck Causal Agents: ,(physiological – several): Bottle neck or otherwise misshapen fruit can be caused by pollination problems or fluctuations in watering. Cultivars can differ in susceptibility. Increasing the bee population by bringing in bee hives and placing them near the melon field may alleviate the problem.
,Watermelon,Sunburn:, The lack of foliage to protect the fruit can result in sunburn. This often occurs as a consequence of loss of foliage caused by fungal diseases such as downy mildew.
,Watermelon,Fruit crack/scarring:," Cracks, scarring, and pitting can be caused by mechanical damage when vegetables are young, Insects can also cause such injury. Animals, such as wild hogs and racoons, can cause more substantial damage."
,Watermelon,Splitting:," Splitting is caused by an erratic watering pattern, particularly the excessive accumulation of water. The inside of the fruit is under great pressure and the fruit splits open when lightly tapped. This condition is weather related and there probably is a cultivar interaction as well."
,Watermelon,Cross-stitch:," There are parallel cuts extending into the rind, which are perpendicular to vascular bundles. The cause is unknown, but it is not suspected to be infectious."
,Turnip & Mustard,White Spot," (fungus – ,): Lesions caused by Cercosporella varies from gray to brown in color. The center of the spots are light colored with slightly darkened margins (,). Severely infected leaves turn yellow and drop. The fungus is seedborne and overwinters on volunteer plants. Spores are spread by splashing rain and airborne spores. The disease is most damaging when daily temperatures range between 55oF and 65oF and during periods of high humidity. Protective type fungicides should be applied on a weekly basis beginning when true leaves are formed if weather conditions are favorable for disease spread.[,] Cultural practices that reduce leaf wetness and inoculum levels will aid in disease control. [,]"
,Turnip & Mustard,White Rust ,"(fungus – ,): The underside of infected leaves are characterized by white blister-like pustules (,). The upper side will have faint yellow spot opposite the white lesion on the underside of the leaf (,). Cruciferous weeds such as wild mustard and shepherd’s purse are other hosts for the fungus and are a source of inoculum for mustard and turnips growing nearby. The fungus is spread by windblown spores and overwinters in crop refuse. Disease development is most rapid at 68oF and during periods of light rain or dew. Control of the disease is based on cultural practices [,]. Currently no fungicides are approved by EPA for the control of this fungus on mustard or turnips."
,Turnip & Mustard,Anthracnose ,"(fungus – ,): Infected leaves are covered with small dry, circular, pale-gray to straw colored lesions (,). Severe infection results in leaf death. On infected roots gray to tan lesions are formed. The bacterial soft rot organism often enters the lesions as a secondary infection and causes additional loss. The fungus overwinters in fallen leaves, on volunteer plants and some weeds. It can be seed transmitted. Optimum fungus growth occurs in a temperature range from 79oF and 86oF. The presence of moisture is important in disease development. Long crop rotations, weed control, and a well drained soil are important to reducing losses to this fungus. [,] Approved fungicides can also be used when the disease appears. [,] Begin fungicide applications when symptoms first appear and continue at 7 to 10 day intervals as long as weather conditions favor disease development."
,Turnip & Mustard,Alternaria Leaf Spot," (fungus – ,): Small circular spots with a yellow halo are formed on the upper leaf surface (,). As the spot matures the center becomes sooty black with age. The black color is partially the result of spore buildup on the surface of the lesion. Lesions are characterized by concentric rings within the lesion. Roots may also become infected when leaves drop on the soil. The fungus grows best at warm to hot temperatures and in the presence of light rainfall and dew. Spores are carried under the seed coat. Cultural practices [,] will help reduce losses to this fungus disease. Apply fungicides at first sign of leaf symptoms. [,]"
,Turnip & Mustard,Downy Mildew," (fungus – ,): The disease is most damaging in the fall and late spring, early summer months. The first symptoms are small faint yellow spots on the upper foliage (,). As they mature, fungus fruiting structures are visible on the underside of the leaf. This growth is especially noticeable in the morning following a period of mild temperatures, high humidity and no wind. Petiole and stem lesions are indistinct, elongated and gray to black in color. In rainy weather, bacterial soft rot may invade plants weakened by downy mildew. Fungicides can be used as preventative sprays. [,] It is important to monitor fields closely for signs of disease build up. Follow cultural practices to reduce inoculum build up and spread. [,]"
,Turnip & Mustard,Black Rot," (bacterium – , pv. ,): Black rot infects a large number of cruciferous plants including several commercially important vegetables. Infected mustard leaves are marked by a “v” shaped lesion on the leaf margin (,). The bacteria enters through the water pores at the leaf margin and then move downward in the vascular strands of the leaf. In black rot infected leaves, the vascular system appears to have black to dark gray strands running through the tissue. Once infected leaves rapidly collapse. Infected leaves after harvest continue to break down in storage. The bacterium is carried in seed and can survive for a short time in the soil. Disease spread within a field is by rain, irrigation water or mechanical injury. Follow a least a 1 year. Longer rotations with non-cruciferous crops are suggested if the disease has been especially severe. Cultural practices can be used to reduce infection. [,] Apply bactericides at first sign of leaf infection. [,] Repeat at weekly intervals as long as weather conditions favor disease development. Damage will be first visible on lower foliage."
,Turnip & Mustard,Bacterial Leaf Spot," (bacterium – , pv. ,): The bacteria that causes bacterial leaf spot is seedborne. Foliage symptoms are pinpoint, watersoaked, olive green lesions (,). As they enlarge the lesions become translucent spots with watersoaked margins. The bacteria not only are spread on infected seed but can possibly survive in the soil and on crop residue for a short period of time. The bacteria are spread by splashing rain and equipment. Cultural practices that reduce the time foliage is wet help to reduce infection. [,] Rotations with vegetables other than members of the crucifer family will help to reduce presence of the bacteria in the soil. Fungicides used for black rot control will also help to control this organism. [,]"
,Turnip & Mustard,Turnip Mosaic," (virus): Leaves of infected plants are mottled and distorted. The entire plant is stunted and yields are reduced (,). Aphids transmit the virus from diseased plants and weeds to healthy plants (,). Field sanitation is important. At the end of harvest, diseased plants or those plants not harvested should be shredded and plowed under or tilled to reduce inoculum increase in an area. [,] If diseased plants are left in place, aphid will continue to increase and as feeding pressure increases, winged forms develop and spread the virus to nearby mustard or turnip plantings. Control cruciferous weeds in and around the field or garden. Volunteer mustard and turnip plants should be destroyed."

,Tomato,Late Blight," (fungus – ,): Lesions produced on the leaves are at first irregular, rather large, greenish-black and water-soaked. These areas enlarge rapidly, becoming brown, and under humid conditions, develop a white moldy growth near the margins of the diseased area on the lower surface of the leaves or on stems. The disease spreads rapidly under humid conditions, destroying quickly large areas of tissue. Fruit lesions occur as large, green to dark brown lesions, mostly on the upper half of the fruit, but they may also occur on other parts. White moldy growth may also appear on fruits under humid conditions. The fungus produces abundant numbers of spores which may be splashed by rains or be airborne. These spores infect healthy leaves, stems and fruit readily if climatic conditions are optimum. Ideal conditions for late blight development are cool nights and moderately warm days with abundant moisture. Hot and dry weather reduces disease development. Infection on tomatoes may occur from nearby potato fields or from airborne spores. Control practices include rotating fields so as not to follow potato or tomato; avoiding planting tomatoes near potatoes; using disease-free seed and transplants. Crops should be sprayed regularly with a fungicide. Spraying should begin whenever weather conditions are favorable for disease development. Applications should continue on a 7 to 10 day schedule until harvest."
,Tomato,Early Blight," (fungus – ,): Early blight is first observed on the plants as small, black lesions mostly on the older foliage. Spots enlarge, and by the time they are one-fourth inch in diameter or larger, concentric rings in a bull’s eye pattern can be seen in the center of the diseased area. Tissue surrounding the spots may turn yellow. If high temperature and humidity occur at this time, much of the foliage is killed. Lesions on the stems are similar to those on leaves, sometimes girdling the plant if they occur near the soil line. Transplants showing infection by the late blight fungus often die when set in the field. The fungus also infects the fruit, generally through the calyx or stem attachment. Lesions attain considerable size, usually involving nearly the entire fruit; concentric rings are also present on the fruit. The fungus is cosmopolitan, affecting a wide range of plants and is present in and on the seed and on crop refuse. Infection of young seedlings usually results from fungi and soil; it occurs principally during periods of high humidity and warm temperature. Control practices include the use of disease-free transplants and regular preventative fungicide applications during the growing season."
,Tomato,Gray Leaf Spot," (fungus – ,): First infection appears as minute, brownish-black specks on the lower leaves that extend through to the undersurface of the leaf. These spots usually remain small, but may enlarge until they are about one-eighth inch in diameter. They become glazed and at times the centers crack and tear across. Infected leaves usually die and drop. Spots also form on the stems. The fungus overwinters primarily on diseased refuse; spread is by airborne spores from diseased to healthy plants. Control measures include crop rotation, seedbed sanitation and preventative fungicide applications as for the control of late and early blight. Resistant varieties should be used when possible."
,Tomato,Leaf-Mold ,"(fungus – ,): Leaf mold is usually first observed on older leaves near the soil where air movement is poor and humidity is high. At first, diffuse whitish spots appear on the upper surfaces of older leaves; these rapidly enlarge and become yellow. Under humid conditions, the lower surface of these spots become covered with a gray, velvety growth of the spores produced by the fungus. When conditions are proper for fungal development, large areas of the field are infected, plants are weakened and the crop is greatly reduced. The fungus produces abundant spores during periods of high temperature and very high relative humidity. Infection occurs readily, and the disease becomes established in the fields quickly. The best control of this disease is by using a preventative fungicide program at 7 to 10 day intervals, the same as used for late and early blight control."
,Tomato,Buckeye Rot ,"(fungus – ,): This disease occurs on tomato mainly on the fruit, particularly where it touches the soil. The fungus is different from the one causing late blight, which affects both leaves and fruit. Buckeye rot is first noticed as a light green water-soaked area on the fruit. Later, dark zonate bands can be seen on the surface of affected areas. The surface of the lesion is usually smooth and firm. With time, the entire fruit will rot. The fungus lives in the soil and it can also affect pepper. The disease is more troublesome in heavy, poorly drained soils during prolonged warm wet weather."
,Tomato,Bacterial Spot," (bacterium – , pv. ,): Infected leaves show small, brown, watersoaked, circular spots about one-eighth inch in diameter. The spots may have a yellow halo; the centers dry out and frequently tear. On older plants the leaflet infection is mostly on older leaves and may cause serious defoliation. The most striking symptoms are on the green fruit. Small, water-soaked spots first appear which later become raised and enlarge until they are one-eighth to one-fourth inch in diameter. Centers of these lesions become irregular, light brown and slightly sunken with a rough, scabby surface. Ripe fruits are not susceptible to the disease. Surface of the seed becomes contaminated with the bacteria, remaining on the seed surface for some time. The organism may also overwinter in alternate hosts, on volunteer tomato plants and on infected plant debris. Moist weather and splattering rains are conducive to disease development. Most outbreaks of the disease can be traced back to heavy rainstorms that occur in the area. Infection of leaves occurs through natural openings; infection of other fruits must occur through insect punctures, sandblasting and other mechanical injury means. Bacterial spot is difficult to control once it appears in the field. Disease-free seed and seedlings should always be used; rotate crops so as to avoid last year’s crop residue; use a combination of copper and organic fungicides in a regular preventative spray program at 5 to 10 day intervals. Dry, hot weather usually checks the disease."
,Tomato,Bacterial Canker," (bacterium ,): Wilting of leaflets is the first symptom; on older plants the margins of the lower leaflets wilt first, the margins dry and the leaflets curl upward. Light colored streaks appear on stems. These streaks later break open at intervals to form cankers in which bacteria ooze may appear. Fruits are infected on the surface, spots appearing first as very small and snowy-white; the margins remain white and flat, but the centers become raised, tan colored and roughened. A white halo develops around the spots, which serves to differentiate the disease from other bacterial spots. The canker organism is seedborne and can remain in the soil and diseased plants for some time. Primary infection, however, is mostly from infected seed. Control can be obtained by using disease-free treated seed and clean transplants."
,Tomato,Nailhead Spot ,"(fungus – ,): Leaf symptoms are the same as those caused by early blight on fruits; however, spots are smaller, with slightly sunken centers and dark margins. As the spots become older, the edges become roughened. On ripe fruit, the tissue immediately around the spots often remains green. Control is the same as for early blight."
,Tomato,Anthracnose ,"(fungi – ,sp.): At first, infected fruit show small, slightly sunken, watersoaked spots. These spots enlarge, become darker in color, depressed and have concentric rings. Masses of the pink fruiting fungus can be seen on the surface of the lesions in moist weather. Under warm and humid conditions, the fungus penetrates the fruit, completely destroying it. The fungus persists on infected plant refuse in the soil. Fruit may be infected when green and small, but do not show any marked lesions until they begin to ripen. Fruit becomes more susceptible as they approach maturity. Control of this disease involves the use of well-drained soil, crop rotation and a preventative fungicide program as recommended for other diseases."
,Tomato,Fusarium Wilt," (fungus – , f. sp. ,): The first indication of disease in small plants is a drooping and wilting of lower leaves with a loss of green color followed by wilting and death of the plant. Often leaves on only one side of the stem turn yellow at first; yellowed leaves gradually wilt and die. The stem of wilted plants shows no soft decay, but when cut lengthwise, the woody part next to the green outer cortex shows a dark brown discoloration of the water conducting vessels. The fungus is soilborne, passes upward into the xylem of the stem. Blocking of the water-conducting vessels is the main reason for wilting. The fungus is most active at temperatures between 80 and 90 degrees F., seldom being a serious problem where soil and air temperatures remain low during most of the growing season. Control can be obtained by growing plants in disease-free soil, using disease-free transplants, and growing only resistant varieties."
,Tomato,Verticillium Wilt," (fungus – ,): The first symptom is yellowing of the older leaves, followed by a slight wilting of the tips of the shoots during the day. Older yellowed leaves gradually wither and drop, and eventually the plant is defoliated. Verticillium wilt does not show the one-sided effect as does Fusarium wilt. Leaves from Verticillium infected plants sometimes show brown dead spots that may be confused with those caused by other fungi. However, they are lighter in color and do not show concentric zones as in early blight. In late stages of the disease, only the leaves near the tips of the branch remain alive. When the stem is cut lengthwise, the base shows a discoloration of the woody tissue similar to Fusarium, but is usually darker, and generally it occurs only in the lower part of the stem. The fungus enters the plant through the feeder roots and grows into the stem in the woody conducting vessels just under the cortex. The fungus lives in the soil for a long time and it is exclusively the source of infection. Progress of the disease is favored by cooler temperatures and is retarded by the high temperatures that are favorable to ,wilt. Locating seedbeds and fields in ,-free soil, and using resistant varieties are the most effective means of controlling the disease."
,Tomato,Gray Mold ,"(fungus – ,): Plants become more susceptible to this disease as they become older. It is mostly a problem in greenhouses, but it can also affect tomatoes in the field. The fungus first becomes established on dead leaves at the base of the plants. A heavy, gray growth of the fungus covers these, and numerous spores are soon found, giving the affected area a cottony appearance. Affected leaves collapse and shrink. The fungus progresses into the stem, producing cankers. Affected fruits first show a watersoaked, soft area in the points of infection. The dark gray growth of the fungus soon is seen on these spots. Regular fungicide applications should help in controlling this disease."
,Tomato,Botryosporium Mold," (fungus – ,sp.): This fungus can often be found on greenhouse tomatoes. It superficially resembles gray mold. Septoria Leaf Spot (fungus – Septoria lycopersici): Infection usually occurs on the lower leaves near the ground, after plants begin to set fruit. At first, small watersoaked spots are observed, which under ideal conditions will become numerous. Large areas of the leaves may be affected but the individual spots can be recognized. The watersoaked spots become roughly circular, with dark margins surrounding a light gray center. With time, black specks which are spore producing bodies can be seen in the center of the spots. If the spots are numerous, the lower leaves will turn yellow, die and progressively drop from the plant until only a few leaves remain on the top of the plant. The fungus is most active when temperatures range from 60oF to 80oF, and humidity conditions are high. The disease is usually not serious during periods of hot, dry weather. The fungus can overwinter on crop residue from previous crops, decaying vegetation and some tomato-related wild hosts. Crop rotation, plowing under crop residues, and clean cultivation will reduce the amount of inoculum in tomato fields. Repeated fungicide applications will keep the disease in check."
,Tomato,Southern Blight," (fungus – ,): The first symptom is dropping of leaves suggestive of other wilts. Wilting progresses and plants die quickly. Stems show decay of outer tissues at the ground line. Frequently, they are covered by a white fungal mat in which are embedded numerous small, light-brown bodies about the size of cabbage seed. The fungus can also attack fruits where they touch the soil. The fungus does not grow at temperatures below 68oF; it requires abundant moisture for growth. Infection takes place below the soil line or close to ground level. Control is obtained by sanitation, crop rotation, and by treating infected soil with a soil fungicide prior to planting."
,Tomato,Blossom End Rot," (nonparasitic): Blossom end rot is a physiological disorder of tomato that can appear on fruits at any time in their development, but most commonly appears when fruits are one-third to one-half grown. The initial symptoms are water-soaked spots on the blossom end of the fruit. These spots later enlarge and become black. Secondary infection by other decay causing organisms usually follows. The cause of this disorder is considered to be calcium deficiency in the developing fruit. Extreme fluctuations in moisture, root pruning and excessive nitrogen fertilization can also result in blossom end rot. Best means of control is to maintain a uniform supply of moisture through irrigation and soil mulches. Calcium chloride can be used as a spray for control under some conditions."
,Tomato,Growth Cracks," (nonparasitic): Growth cracks result from extremely rapid fruit growth brought on by periods of abundant rain and high temperatures, especially when these conditions take place following periods of stress. Cracks of varying depth radiate from the stem end of the fruit, blemishing the fruit and providing an entrance for decay-causing organisms. No control practices are known."
,Tomato,Tobacco Mosaic," (virus): Symptoms are light and dark green mottling of the tomato foliage, and curling and slight malformation of the leaflets. Plants may be somewhat stunted if infected when small, but the plants and fruit are not much reduced in size if plants are not infected until they reach the fruiting stage. Several strains of the virus are known that can cause different symptoms. The virus is highly infectious and readily transmitted by any means that introduces even a minute amount of sap from infected to healthy plants. The most common means of transmission is by handling contaminated plants. The virus may also be present in certain types of tobacco; therefore, smokers may transmit the disease. Control measures are: avoiding handling plants more than necessary, washing hands before handling plants, and protecting healthy plants from infection."
,Tomato,Double Streak Virus," (virus): Caused by a combination of viruses. Leaves show a light-green mottling, accompanied by the development of numerous small, grayish-brown, dead spots which have a thick, paper appearance. Numerous narrow, dark brown streaks develop on the stem and leaf petiole. Fruits are often rough and misshapen and on the surface they have small, irregular, greasy, brown patches which render them unfit to market. The virus is transmitted by workers handling the crop. Avoid infection by tobacco mosaic virus, wash hands before starting to work and remove infected plants."
,Tomato,Spotted Wilt," (virus): This disease is similar to streak in that it causes streaking of the leaves, stems and fruits. Numerous small, dark, circular spots appear on younger leaves. Leaves may have a bronzed appearance and later turn dark brown and wither. Fruits show numerous spots about one-half inch in diameter with concentric, circular markings. On ripe fruit these markings are alternate bands of red and yellow. The virus also affects other vegetables and many wild hosts and ornamental plants. Thrips can transmit the disease from the wild hosts. For control, eliminate weeds around field edges and turnrows; remove infected plants when small, and control insects in the field."
,Tomato,Curly Top," (virus): Pronounced upward rolling and twisting of the leaflets that expose their undersurfaces, stiff and leathery foliage, and a peculiar dull yellowing of the entire plant are typical symptoms of the disease. There is also some purpling of the veins and the plant is usually very stunted. Very few fruits are produced after infection. The virus is not transmitted through the seed or soil, nor is it spread by mechanical means. The main vector is the beet leafhopper that becomes infected by feeding on wild or cultivated plants having the disease. The disease is difficult to control. Keep field surroundings free of weeds. Controlling insects may effect some control."
,Tomato,Root Knot Nematodes," (,spp.): Root knot nematodes represent one of the major limiting factors to tomato production. Preventing their entry into growing areas is an important mean of control. Susceptible varieties growing in infested soil will have knots or galls on the root system. Once present it becomes necessary to use a resistant variety or to apply nematicide. Refer to the section on nematodes for more information. Use of resistant varieties is the most effective method of reducing nematode losses."
,Tomato,Greenhouse diseases ,"– All of the diseases affecting tomatoes in the field can damage tomatoes in the greenhouse. If proper precautions are not taken, severe losses can occur to tomatoes grown under greenhouse conditions. Among the most common diseases of tomatoes under greenhouse conditions are:"

,Tomato,,
,Tomato,Seedling Diseases," (fungi – ,sp., ,sp.): Seedlings fail to emerge or small seedlings wilt and die soon after emergence. Surviving plants may have infected root systems and watersoaked areas on the stem close to the soil line. As the plants mature, they become more resistant to damping-off. Avoid excessive moisture in the seedbed, plant seed treated with fungicides and use sterilized media for growing transplants."
,Sweet Potato,Bacterial Stem and Root Rot," (bacterium – ,): More common in storage than in fields. Infected areas inside potatoes are light brown and watery (,). Plants show dark brown to black lesions on stems with dark streaking in the vascular tissue (,). Storage root infection and vine infections often occur independent of each other. The bacterium is favored by high temperatures and humid conditions. Some varieties are more susceptible than others. Control: Reduce wounding, select clean seed potatoes, and maintain adequate gas exchange while plant beds are covered."
,Sweet Potato,Black Rot," (fungus – ,): Circular, almost black spots appear on sweet potato roots. Affected and adjacent areas have a bitter taste. Small, black lesions often completely girdle underground stems. The causal organism fruits abundantly in storage, which helps separate black rot from other storage rots. Once the most important sweet potato disease, black rot is difficult to find today."
,Sweet Potato,Cold Damage," (physiological): Pithy, dark discolorations will appear internally on sweet potatoes subjected to low temperatures. Temperatures do not have to reach the freezing point to cause damage. Sweet potato is a tropical plant and will suffer injury at temperatures below 55oF."
,Sweet Potato,Cotton Root Rot," – See Page on ,."
,Sweet Potato,Foot Rot," (fungus – ,): Foot rot is a relatively minor disease. On infected vines, the base of the stem turns brown at the soil line and leaves nearest the crown turn yellow and drop. It is most commonly observed from mid-season to harvest. Individual plants may produce few potatoes even though large vines develop during the season. The potatoes that are produced develop a firm brown rot at the stem end. Seldom is the entire root affected. Controls recommended for black rot and scurf will also control this disease. If foot rot is recognized to be a serious problem, then early harvest will aid in reducing losses."
,Sweet Potato,Growth Cracks," (physiological): Scientists have not yet determined the conditions that cause cracking of sweet potatoes. In some varieties, it appears to be an inherited characteristic. Rotation reduces incidence of growth cracks."
,Sweet Potato,Root Knot," (nematode – ,sp.): Root cracking is often associated with severe root knot infection (,). Pitting and other surface blemishes are also noted. Vines may be stunted and show nutritional deficiencies. For diagnosis, split small, whip-like roots longitudinally and look for pearl-like swollen female nematodes embedded in the flesh (,). Often the area surrounding the nematode is dark. Nematodes may also be embedded in mature potato flesh but are more easily viewed for diagnostic purposes in smaller roots. Small galls or swellings can be detected on fibrous roots. Control options include crop rotation, resistant varieties, nematicide treatments and careful selection of seed potatoes. Cut slips above soil line to prevent transfer of infected roots to planting fields."
,Sweet Potato,Russet Crack and Internal Cork," (virus – Sweetpotato feathery mottle virus): The virus is transmitted by aphids and it is believed all sweet potatoes are infected. Symptoms, however, vary depending on strains of the virus and variety. Russet Crack is associated with Jersey-type sweet potatoes. Small, longitudinal cracks encircle parts of storage rots (,). Internal cork was once a serious problem, especially in the Puerto Rico variety. Brown to black corky areas develop in the flesh of roots and can go undetected until sliced. Modern day varieties are resistant to these two symptoms. Foliar symptoms vary from purple ring spots to vein clearing."
,Sweet Potato,Scurf ,"(fungus – ,): Scurf is most severe in wet or poorly drained soils. Scurf appears as light brown blotches on the outside of roots (,). These areas may be small or run together to form large, irregular patches. Although superficial, only skin deep, infection reduces grade and causes undue shrinkage in storage. Avoid use of scurfy seed potatoes. Treat seed potato roots with a fungicide before bedding. Cut slips just above the soil line for transplanting. Practice rotations of three to five years. Avoid planting where organic matter in the soil is not well decomposed."
,Sweet Potato,Soil Rot," (bacterium – ,): Soil rot, also called pox, is a storage root and fibrous plant root disease. Storage roots are often misshapened with rough, scabby pits or shallow surface lesions that result in scars (,). Fibrous roots develop dark, necrotic lesions that eventually kill the root. Serious plant losses result when heavy infection occurs immediately after transplanting. Soil rot is favored as soil pH rises above 5.2. Crop rotation, resistant or tolerant varieties and soil fumigation are means of control. Soil rot is widespread and a major disease on sweet potato."
,Sweet Potato,Stem Rot," (fungus – , f. sp. ,): Young leaves at the tips of vines turn yellow while older leaves wilt then drop so that the center of the hill becomes bare. Infested slips may die soon after setting or become stunted and yellow. Stems at the soil line may turn slightly blue (blue-stem). The inner stem portion at or below the soil line becomes discolored with brown streaks in the vascular system. Selection of seed roots free of the disease is difficult because external symptoms are not always present. Resistant varieties have greatly diminished losses to stem rot."
,Sweet Potato,Storage Rots ,"(fungi – soft rot – ,, Java black rot – ,, charcoal rot – , and others): Storage rot losses are greatly reduced when disease control practices are followed that yield high quality sweet potatoes from the field. Some fungi causing storage rots infect roots in the field before harvest while others enter the potatoes through wounds made at harvest or during handling. Decayed spots may be dry or soft, the latter due principally to Rhizopus rot. Sweet potatoes should be cured for seven to 10 days at 85oF. and at 90 percent relative humidity before being stored. Curing allows a natural healing process to take place. Potatoes should be stored at 55oF to 60oF, and at 85% – 90% relative humidity. Avoid rough handling between curing and storage because additional wounding may occur. Store in a thoroughly clean and disinfected room with adequate ventilation. Do not permit the storage temperature to drop below 55oF. or injury will occur. For control of ,rot during the processing-to-market interval, apply a fungicide spray immediately after washing, when potatoes are on conveyor belts or rollers."

,Spinach,White Rust," (fungus – ,): White rust is the major disease of spinach in Texas. White, blister-like pustules form on the lower side of the leaf. In advanced stages, the white lesions form on the upper side of the leaf. Generally, the upper surface will only be chlorotic. Plants infected with the white rust fungus are weak and collapse quickly if environmental conditions are favorable for disease development. Initial outbreaks each season follow source event such as hard rains that deposit soil and oospores on the young plants. The fungus oversummers in soil as dormant thick-walled oospores and may spread within a field by windblown spores. Free moisture on the leaf surface must be present for spore germination and development. The optimum temperature for germination is 54oF. The disease develops most rapidly at 72oF or during periods of cool, humid nights and mild day temperatures. No variety is totally resistant to white rust but a few have very useful partial resistance, including Green Valley II, Ozarka II, Coho and Fall Green. A disease control program should combine the benefits of cultural practices, partial resistance, a systemic fungicide at planting (in Texas, Ridomil 5G) and protective fungicides sprays (beginning 40-50 days after planting). Cultural practices should include long rotations, planting on beds and furrow irrigation. The risk of developing tolerance to Ridomil fungicide is reduced if all of these disease control practices are used together."
,Spinach,Downy Mildew or Blue Mold," (fungus – ,): The downy mildew fungus first causes yellowish areas on the upper side of the leaf. The underneath side of the leaf is marked by a gray to violet-gray fungal growth mat that bears sporangia. The entire leaf is killed on susceptible varieties under optimum environmental conditions. The fungus overwinters in living spinach plants and in the seed. The fungus spores require surface moisture for development. Optimum temperature is around 48oF for germination and 54oF to 60oF for development. This disease can be controlled by the use of varieties resistant to races 1, 2 and 3."
,Spinach,Anthracnose ,"(fungus – ,): Anthracnose shows up as small, dark olive colored spots. As the spots enlarge, they become tan in color. As the lesions coalesce, they kill the entire leaf. During periods of favorable disease development, the foliage appears as if the crop will be lost. With a change in weather, the diseased foliage drops off and the healthy foliage goes on to produce a crop. The fungus overwinters in seed and in crop refuse. Fungicides used in a white rust control will also control anthracnose."
,Spinach,Leaf Spots," (fungi – ,): These are minor diseases of spinach which may cause damage in some years. ,leaf spots are white and, usually, small in size. Extended periods of precipitation and high humidity may allow spots to become large and even coalesce. Protective type fungicides offer some control. Ridomil does not control ,."
,Spinach,,
,Spinach,Fusarium Decline ,"(fungus – , f. sp. ,): Plants are subject to infection at any stage of development. Infected plants turn yellow and wilt. The lower, older foliage is affected first. Plants which are infected are either stunted or killed. Infected plants lose their feeder roots and the vascular system of the taproot is darkened. The fungus is seed borne and can live in the soil indefinitely. Fortunately, white rust resistant varieties also have Fusarium resistance."
,Spinach,Blight ,"(virus): Cucumber mosaic virus attacks spinach causing plants to become faintly chlorotic. Chlorosis increases until the entire plant becomes yellow. Crown leaves are narrow, wrinkled and develop an inward rolling of the margins. Plants are stunted. Death may occur in some severely infected plants. The virus is aphid transmitted. Most commercial varieties are resistant [,]."

,Spinach,Seedling Disease ,"(fungi – ,spp., ,spp., ,spp., Others): Preemergence and postemergence damping off can seriously reduce stands. Rotate with corn, plant after soils have cooled down in the late summer or fall, use a fungicide seed treatment and buy fresh, high quality seed."
,Spinach,Tobacco Ringspot," (virus): First symptoms are small, indistinct, chlorotic spots which appear on the young foliage. These may coalesce to form large yellow areas. In advanced stages, leaves take on a copper bronze chlorosis. There is no malformation of the foliage. Affected plants rarely die but remain yellow and stunted. No control measures are known."
,Spinach,Beet Curly-Top," (virus): Infected plants are marked by a rosette of tightly curled, small leaves in the center of the plant. As the disease develops, the growing point is killed and the plant dies. The virus is transmitted by beet leafhoppers."

,"Southern Pea (Blackeye, Cowpea)",Ashy Stem Blight," (fungus – ,): Plants die quickly. Lower stem is gray with internal black flecking of tissue. Most serious when mature plants come under moisture stress. Same as charcoal rot. See the section on ,."
,"Southern Pea (Blackeye, Cowpea)",Bacterial Blight," (bacterium – ,): This disease appears as tan to brown angular leaf spots with yellow margins on leaves, pods, and stems. It may cause severe defoliation during periods of high humidity. See section on bacterial blight of bean."
,"Southern Pea (Blackeye, Cowpea)",Cotton Root Rot," (fungus – ,): See Page on ,."
,"Southern Pea (Blackeye, Cowpea)",Curly Top," – See Page on ,."
,"Southern Pea (Blackeye, Cowpea)",Marginal Yellowing and Burning of Leaves," (physiological): In sandy soils of East Texas, this may result from potassium deficiency in the soil. Other causes may be drouth, low pH, or any factor interfering with normal root functions."
,"Southern Pea (Blackeye, Cowpea)",Mosaic ,"(virus): Several viruses produce a mosaic pattern on peas. These viruses may be found singularly or in combination with others. They cause irregular light and dark green mosaic patterns in the leaves (,). Some viruses cause thickened, malformed leaves similar in appearance to damage caused by hormone herbicides. The mosaic patterns are best observed on the younger foliage. Plants may be stunted and fail to produce normal pods. It is best to plant healthy, disease-free seed rather than saving seed from a crop that showed infection. The pinkeye purplehull variety is highly susceptible to Blackeye Cowpea Mosaic Virus (BlCMV). This virus can be seed borne and is common where pinkeye purplehull is grown. (,) Resistant purplehull varieties include Pinkeye Purplehull BVR, Mopod and Texas Pinkeye. Crowder type peas have shown good resistance to BlCMV. See variety listing at end of section."
,"Southern Pea (Blackeye, Cowpea)",Leaf Spots," (fungi – ,sp., ,sp., ,sp., ,sp., ,sp.): Various sized spots often yellowish in color or with a yellow halo, others brown to purplish; these normally develop first on lower leaves (,). With Cercospora leafspot a dark, moldy growth develops on the lower leaf surface opposite the spot. Leafspot diseases are most serious during periods of prolonged moist weather and on late summer or early fall plantings. Severe leaf spotting results in defoliation with subsequent yield reductions. Practice crop rotation; avoid cultivating fields when foliage is wet."
,"Southern Pea (Blackeye, Cowpea)",Pod Blight," (fungus – ,): Pods and the stalk supporting the pods become watersoaked. A whiskery-type fungal growth develops on the affected tissue, which usually begins at the point of pod attachment (,). Disease is associated with high humidity and possibly insect feeding. Rotate and destroy crop residue."
,"Southern Pea (Blackeye, Cowpea)",Powdery Mildew," (fungus – ,): Symptoms consist of a light, grayish, powdery growth on the leaves, pods and occasionally the stems. This powdery growth is easily rubbed off. When the disease is severe, plants turn yellow and defoliate. Generally, powdery mildew does not damage early planted peas. It can, however, be quite destructive on a fall or late summer crop."
,"Southern Pea (Blackeye, Cowpea)",Root Knot," (nematode – ,sp.): Relatively small galls or knots develop on roots of affected plants. Don’t confuse root knot galls with naturally occurring bacterial galls that are beneficial. See the section on root knot nematode for more information. Resistant or tolerant varieties are available."
,"Southern Pea (Blackeye, Cowpea)",Rust ,"(fungus – ,): Small, reddish-brown pustules appear on both upper and lower leaf surfaces (,). Rust can develop rapidly, resulting in severe leaf damage and defoliation. Check current clearances of fungicides effective in controlling rust. Sulfur may be used."
,"Southern Pea (Blackeye, Cowpea)",Seedling Disease," (fungi – ,sp., ,sp., ,sp.): Seed may rot and young seedlings die. The condition is most common on early plantings or when soil contains a large amount of nondecomposed plant residue. Treat seed with an approved fungicide. Avoid planting in wet, cold soils."
,"Southern Pea (Blackeye, Cowpea)",Southern Blight," (fungus – ,): See Page on ,."
,"Southern Pea (Blackeye, Cowpea)",Wilt ,"(fungus – , f. sp. ,): The lower leaves turn yellow and fall. Death may be rapid after wilting is noted.

,Radish,White Rust," (fungus – ,): White, raised spore masses appear on the underside of leaves. Even though the disease is confined usually to the leaves, it may affect other parts of the plant. The host epidermis is ruptured and powdery masses of spores are produced. Spots may range from minute dots to one-half inch or more in diameter. With mild temperature and high humidity, the disease spreads quickly. Extreme hot or cold temperatures and dry weather will slow the disease progress. The following practices should control white rust: destroy crop residue, and cultivate fields prior to planting to destroy all volunteer plants."
,Radish,Cercospora Leafspot," (fungi – , and ,): The fungus attacks the cotyledons, leaves, and petioles of the host plant. Lesions are circular with gray, brown or slightly off-white centers with slightly darkened margins. Severe infection can cause yellowing of foliage and eventual defoliation. Young seedlings are killed whereas later infection causes a reduction in size of the edible portion. The fungus is soilborne and can live in several weeds or old volunteer plants. Stromata are formed in the leaves and these overwinter in the fallen foliage. When weather conditions favor fungal development, growth resumes. Spores are formed from this tissue and they are carried by wind or splashed onto the foliage by rain. The disease organism is favored by cool temperatures (55oF to 65oF) and free moisture on the leaves. Deep plowing or removal of infected plant parts will help break the life cycle of the organism. All volunteer members of the cabbage family and cruciferous weeds should be destroyed in and around the area where radishes are to be grown."
,Radish,Bacterial Leaf Spot," (bacterium – , pv. ,): The bacterium attacks the leaves and petioles causing small tan to white spots with narrow, yellowish, watersoaked zones on the leaves. The spots on the leaf petioles are black, sunken and elongated. Severe infection results in defoliation and, in extremely severe cases, death may occur. The causal organism is carried over in the crop residue and in infected seed. Once a plant is infected, further spread is by insects, rain, etc. During warm spring days, lesions are visible four to five days after infection. In cooler periods development is slower. The bacterium will grow between temperatures of 41oF 94oF, but is favored by temperatures between 80oF 86oF. Field sanitation is important in preventing infection. Rotation will also reduce the possibility of the disease becoming a problem. Use high quality seed. Chemicals are not recommended."
,Radish,Black Root ,"(fungus – ,): The fungus attacks radishes at any stage of plant development. Early infection results in seedling death. Some escapes will occur which, although infected, continue to develop. This often is visible as a deep crater type lesion. Field sanitation and rotation will help reduce the occurrence of black root. Cool wet soil favors development. Planting on a raised bed in well drained soil will prevent losses. Fungicides are not currently recommended for the control of black root."

,Seed Treatment,,
,Irish Potato,Bacterial Wilt or Brown Rot ,"(bacterium – ,): Stems discolor (at first only on inside) and plants wilt and die. Tubers with a dark, vascular ring may decay. Avoid infested fields and plant seed from northern states. Discard tubers with dark eyes or with sticky ooze on surface."
,Irish Potato,Blackleg ,"(bacterium – , subsp. ,): The lower parts of affected stems develop an inky black , slimy , foul-smelling , soft rot. Leaves near tops of vines curl upward and become stunted. Aerial tubers usually form in leaf axils. Severely affected plants die. Tubers from affected plants show black stem-end discoloration and sometimes a severe black soft rot in storage. Plant certified, healthy seed in well-drained soil. Cut seed tubers with a disinfected knife. Treat seedpieces and cure properly before planting."
,Irish Potato,Early Blight," (fungus – ,): Mycelium and spores of ,survive in crop residue. Frequent rain and heavy dews are needed for heavy infection. First symptoms are oval to angular dark-brown to black target spots on the leaves (,). Spots often have a yellow area around them. The lowest or oldest leaves are infected first. Leaves are often killed and yields are reduced. Tuber infection may occur with brown-black sunken spots, from to inch in diameter. The underlying tissue shows a brown, corky, dry rot more than inch deep. Control with 2 year rotation, good fertility and foliar fungicides [,]."
,Irish Potato,Late Blight," (fungus – ,): Water-soaked spots enlarge rapidly and turn brown to black. Very humid conditions may produce white mold on the underside of the leaf. Under cool, wet conditions blight may attack petioles and stems, ruining a field in a few days. Blight spores can infect tubers at harvest or while in the ground. Late blight has been verified in the Winter Garden, but has not been reported on the High Plains. Some of the isolates were shown to be metalaxyl resistant. Use fungicide applications [see table above] and delay harvest about 2 weeks until vines are killed by chemical treatment."
,Irish Potato,Pink Rot of Tubers," (fungi – , and ,): Diseased tubers are spongy and initially discolored around the point of stolon attachment. Later, they become discolored around the buds and lenticels. The internal tissues appear cream-colored when cut, but turn salmon pink after 15 – 20 minutes. They gradually become darker, turning black after about 1 hour. Diseased potatoes have been observed in the Texas High Plains primarily in furrow irrigated fields with clay soils. Control includes selecting sites with good soil drainage and avoiding excessive irrigation late in the growing season."
,Irish Potato,Ring Rot," (bacterium – ,): Resembles brown rot, but stem is not discolored. Use certified seed from areas where ring rot is not permitted."
,Irish Potato,Scab ,"(fungus – ,): Rough, corky areas that may be round or irregular occur on tubers. Injury does not extend far into the potato but the appearance is objectional. Scab is less prevalent in acid soils than in alkaline. Avoid alkaline soil amendments such as manure, lime, or ashes. Avoid severely infested fields. Apply heavy irrigation at the time of tuber or early root formation. Use a 4 to 6 year rotation under irrigation. A 3 to 4 year rotation is satisfactory under dry land conditions. Use certified seed of scab resistant varieties. Treat seedpieces (See in the chapter on “,“). Wire worm damage, commonly called “deep scab”, is not a disease. It differs in that the pits are deep and tissue has been removed by insect feeding. Sulfur may be used in home gardens to make the soil more acid."
,Irish Potato,Scurf and Stem Rot," (fungus – ,sp.): Small, hard black bodies adhere to the surface of the tuber. Below ground part of stem turns brown. Aerial tubers are sometimes formed. Rotate crops. Use certified seed. Treat seed as for scab."
,Irish Potato,"Curly Top, Several Mosaics, Leaf Roll, Spindle Tuber"," (viruses): Plants may be stunted and off-color. Foliage is mottled or leaflets tend to roll up. Tubers are often small, and in case of spindle tuber, elongated. Several viruses can infect potato without causing noticeable symptoms. However, yields can be reduced drastically. Use of seed certified to be true to variety and free of disease agents is the best way to control tuber-borne viruses. Control insects."
,Irish Potato,Spotted Wilt," (virus – Tomato Spotted Wilt Virus): This virus is vectored by thrips insects. Early symptoms are dead spots on upper leaves and death of the upper plant parts. Early leaf symptoms may somewhat resemble early blight, but spotted wilt symptoms will usually be in the top of the plant rather than on lower leaves. Plant seed certified to be free of disease agents. Control broadleaf weeds in and around fields 4 to 5 weeks before planting."
,Irish Potato,Other Diseases:," Potatoes are damaged severely by other diseases including ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, and , (also called Purple Top)."
,Irish Potato,,
,Parsnip,Leaf Spot," (fungus – Alternaria sp.): Small to medium size spots develop on leaves. They are usually yellowish when young and later turn brown (,). The disease is favored by warm, wet weather. Sustained leaf wetness favors infection. Cultural controls include a wide row spacing to permit air circulation so that leaves stay wet for a limited period of time."
,Parsnip,Powdery Mildew," (fungus – Erysiphe sp.): Leaves are covered with a fine, white powdery coating (,). The disease is favored by warm, dry weather. Altering row spacing and row orientation into prevailing wind will allow air to circulate within the crop canopy, reducing the highly humid microclimate that favors disease development."
,Pepper,Bacterial Leaf Spot," (bacterium – , pv. ,): The bacterium causes spots on both foliage and fruit. Small, yellowish green to brown spots develop on the leaves. Under favorable weather conditions, spots become numerous and sometimes coalesce into large spots. Infected leaves turn yellow and fall off. The disease is seed and soilborne. Infected seed serves as source of infection to emerging seedlings. Splashing rains spread the organism from diseased to healthy plants in the field. Control can be obtained by using disease-free seed and starting a preventative fungicide program early in the growing season. Applications should be made at periodic intervals and continued during the growing season. Genetic resistance may be available in certain types of peppers, however, most of the common green pepper types are susceptible."
,Pepper,Black Spot," (unknown, possibly physiological): There are black circular or irregular-shaped spots on mature fruit that are beneath the epidermis and are not raised. The discoloration extends to the interior of the fruit. No pathogens have been found in association with this disease and factors required for its development are not known. The disease occurs occassionally in Texas."
,Pepper,Damping Off," (fungi – , spp.): Small, emerging seedlings wilt and die soon after emergence. Root systems of surviving plants are damaged, resulting in stunted plants and poor yield. Use high quality seed that have been treated with a fungicide and plant on a well-drained bed."
,Pepper,Herbicide Injury:, Trifluralin (Treflan) injury can cause swelling of the stem near the soil line.
,Pepper,Leaf Spot," (fungus – ,): This disease rarely occurs in Texas. Spots on leaves are large and oval or somewhat oblong, with light gray centers. Spots may also be present on the stem. Severely infected leaves turn yellow and drop. The fungus does not live in the soil but is carried in the seed. Most field infections can be traced to infected seed. The spores of the fungus can be carried by wind and splashing rains. Control can be attained by using disease-free seed that are treated with a fungicide. Fungicide applications at 7 to 10 day intervals will check the disease in the field."
,Pepper,Phytophthora Blight," (fungus – ,): The disease is caused by a fungus that lives in the soil and may be carried in seed. Infection usually takes place at the soil line; diseased plants may be girdled at the base causing sudden wilting and death of plant. Diseased parts of the stem shows a dark green, watersoaked band extending from the soil line to several inches up the stem. This band later dies and turns brown. When peppers are grown with furrow irrigation, sometimes a single infected row is observed in the field. This is the result of the fungus being carried by water down the furrow from a diseased plant and resulting in the infection and death of several plants in the same row. Planting on a raised bed and avoiding excessive moisture in the plant bed are the best means of controlling this disease."
,Pepper,Powdery Mildew ,"(fungus – ,): Yellow areas that may become brown occur on the upper leaf surface. A white, powdery growth occurs on the underside of the leaf. Heavy infection may result in defoliation. The disease is favored by warm, humid conditions. It is not a common or significant disease in Texas."
,Pepper,Southern Blight," (fungus – ,): The fungus attacks the stem of the plant at or near the soil line, causing the plant to wilt and die. A white, cotton growth is observed on the surface of the stem. Later, pink to brown bodies resembling radish seed appear in the fungal growth. Crop rotation and deep plowing are means of controlling this disease. Soil fungicides may be helpful where Southern Blight has been a problem."
,Pepper,Sunscald ,"(physiological): Portions of the fruit have a dried, bleached appearance and are sunken. The tissue is often colonized by saprophytic fungi, which give it a black, velvety appearance and lead to the wrong conclusion that a fungus is the cause of the problem. This disease occurs as a result of exposure of fruit to direct sunlight and can be a consequence of the defoliation caused by leaf-infecting pathogens."
,Pepper,Mosaic ,"(virus): Several viruses are known to attack pepper. Often plants are infected by a combination of viruses, rather than by a single strain. Young leaves of affected plants show a greenish-yellow mottle and may be curved and irregular in shape. Leaves curl upward and under severe infection are bunched, very small and discolored. Plants are stunted and have a bunched appearance. Fruits are small, misshapen and of poor quality. Severe infection can result in the complete failure of the crop. There are no effective means of control. The virus overwinters in perennial weeds and is transmitted from weeds to healthy plants in the fields by aphids. Environmental conditions favoring aphid multiplication and migration into the field will result in severe outbreaks of the disease. Keeping fields clean of weeds around the edges and turnrows and controlling insects may help in reducing spread of the disease. Resistant varieties are now available in limited supply. Check with your county Extension agent on currently used varieties."
,Parsley,Leaf Spots," (fungi – ,sp., ,sp., ,sp., ,sp.): Small to medium size spots develop on leaves. They are usually yellowish when young and later turn brown. No fungicides are cleared on parsley."
,Onion,Black Mold:," (fungus – ,) Black mold is generally a post-harvest disease, although it may be seen on mature onions in the field. The disease can be recognized by the presence of black powdery spore masses of the fungus on the outer scales. High temperatures (85oF-95oF) and moisture favor disease development. Bulbs should be protected from moisture during harvesting and shipping."
,Onion,Botrytis Leaf Blight/Blast," (fungi – ,, and ,): Botrytis leaf blight or blast occurs sporadically in Texas, usually early in the season. Several species of Botrytis infect onion. Seedlings may be infected (,). Neck rot is caused by B. allii, leaf fleck is caused by B. cinerea, and leaf blight is caused by B. squamosa. White flecks are found along the length of the leaf (,) and usually have greenish halos. With numerous flecks, the tip of the leaf may die. Non-pathogenic causes of flecks can include: cold rain, sleet, and sandblasting. Fungicides used to control purple blotch will also control Botrytis leaf blight."
,Onion,Downy Mildew," (fungus – ,): Downy mildew is an occasional disease of onion in the Lower Rio Grande Valley of Texas. Symptoms consist of white to light green spots on leaves, which later darken. A fuzzy, gray growth is seen on the leaf surface, particularly during periods of high humidity (,). Lesions enlarge and leaf tissue dies. Lesions may resemble those caused by the purple blotch fungus. Fields should be monitored closely, particularly during prolonged cold, wet weather, when the disease is more likely to occur. Fungicides that are highly effective against downy mildew, such as Ridomil and Aliette, should be applied following the first report of downy mildew in the growing area."
,Onion,Fusarium Basal Plate Rot," (fungus – ,): The disease develops at the base of the bulb, causing it to become soft. A semi-watery decay progresses from the base of the scales upward (,). The disease may not be noticed until after harvest, when the entire bulb is destroyed. The fungus is soilborne and enters the bulb through wounds, insect injuries or through root scars at the base. High soil temperatures (77oF – 82oF) favor disease development. Losses can be reduced with a 4-year rotation out of onions. Cultivars can also vary in resistance."
,Onion,Leaf Variegation," (Chimera): The leaves have distinct yellow or white longitudinal segments (,). Affected plants occur very infrequently. This is a genetic abnormality."
,Onion,Mushy Rot," (fungus – Rhizopus spp.): Bulbs have soft areas around the neck. In the neck area, there is a white fuzzy growth with black speckling. This is a post-harvest problem that occurs when onions that are not properly cured or stored are transported at high temperatures."
,Onion,Neck Rot," (fungus – Botrytis allii, Botrytis sp.): This disease is frequently not noticed in the field because damage usually occurs during transit and storage. Diseased tissue at the base of the crown becomes sunken and watersoaked in appearance. A gray fungal growth later forms on the surface (,), which can be followed by other fungi and bacteria, causing decay. Small, black-resting bodies (sclerotia) can sometimes be found on scales. Careful handling of the crop at harvest and prompt drying of onions with heat and air ventilation are the best means of controlling this disease."
,Onion,Pink Root," (fungus – ,): Pink root is a soilborne disease that affects roots. Diseased roots turn pink, shrivel and die (,). As the plant sends out new roots, they also become infected and die. Affected plants do not usually die, although they may develop tip blight. Severe infection will reduce bulb size. The fungus can be introduced to a field by using transplants grown in infested soil. Once a field becomes infested, the fungus remains in the soil for many years. Soil fumigation has been shown to be an effective, but expensive, control measure. Resistant onion cultivars are one management approach, as is a long rotation out of onions."
,Onion,Powdery mildew," (fungus – ,): Powdery mildew occurs rarely in the Lower Rio Grande Valley of Texas. The earliest symptom is a pale discoloration of the leaf. Circular spots with white, powdery growth eventually occur. There are no control recommendations, since the disease is not a serious problem."
,Onion,Purple Blotch," (fungus – ,): The fungus usually infects dead or dying leaf tissue. The first symptoms are small, white, sunken lesions. These lesions develop purple centers and enlarge (,). The infection can encompass much of the leaf, leading to the death of tissue above the lesion (,). The disease can be controlled with fungicides. In the Rio Grande Valley of Texas, the need to apply fungicides can be determined by monitoring leaf wetness during the growing season. Leaf wetness occurs as the result of dew, fog or rain. The action threshold is 12 hours of continuous leaf wetness."
,Onion,Pythium Root Rot," (fungus – ,): This disease is most serious with young plants growing under conditions of high soil moisture and cool temperatures. Infected roots become water-soaked and flimsy (,). Not all of the roots of the plant become infected (,). The plants will not usually die, but severe infection can result in small bulbs. The loss of a substantial amount of roots will lead to tip dieback. Planting on raised beds will minimize the impact of this disease."
,Onion,Root Knot:," (,)"
,Onion,Soft Rot," (bacteria – , and other species): Soft rot is one of the more prevalent causes of loss in storage onions. The soft rot bacterium can enter the neck tissues as plants approach maturity. In the field, plants wilt and die (,). As the rot progresses, invaded scales become soft and foul-smelling. Onions with mechanical injuries, sunscald, or bruises are particularly susceptible to bacterial soft rot, especially if they have been held under warm, humid conditions."
,Onion,Stemphyllium Blight," (fungus – ,): Lesions are initially light yellow to brown and water-soaked. They elongate, often reaching the leaf tips, and become dark brown to black. The disease can become serious following periods of more than 24 hours of rainy weather. Fungicides used to control purple blotch will also control this disease."
,Onion,Tip Blight ,"(several causes): Infection by several species of fungi infecting leaves or roots can result in tip dieback. There can also be many non-pathogenic causes. These include: overcrowding, insect injury (particularly thrips and leaf miners), drought or salt stress, wind dessication, and occasionally, damage by ozone gas produced by lightning during severe thunderstorms."
,Onion,Bacterial Blight," (bacterium – ,): This disease is not common in Texas. The symptoms are elongated chlorotic areas on one side of the leaf. These areas become sunken, water soaked and necrotic. Eventually, the leaf dies. The pathogen is seed borne, but could spread within a field following rain or overhead irrigation. Disease development is favored by temperatures greater than 68°F. There are no control recommendations."
,Okra,Fusarium Wilt," (fungus – Fusarium oxysporum F. sp. vasinfectum): The most obvious symptom is a typical wilt, followed by death. Infected plants may be stunted and yellow. The fungus invades the root system and colonizes the vascular system. In doing so, water movement is blocked and toxins from the fungus alter normal cell function. Cutting the base of the stem reveals a dark woody portion. No control is available other than a long rotation. All varieties are susceptible."
,Okra,Root Knot Nematode," (nematode – ,sp.): Okra is highly susceptible. Root becomes enlarged and distorted. See the section on root knot nematodes. No resistant varieties are available."
,Okra,Leaf Spot ,"(fungi – ,): There are several leaf spotting organisms which attack okra. However, none have been shown to cause economic loss. No control is recommended."
,Okra,Blossom and Fruit Blight," (fungus – ,): Young fruit and blossoms are attacked by the fungus which gives them a “whiskery” appearance. Infected plant parts are reduced to a soft rotten substance. Disease development is favored by warm, humid weather. Spray with an approved fungicide."
,Okra,Seedling Disease," (fungus – ,sp.): This disease is more likely to occur if okra is planted before soils warm sufficiently in the spring. See the Seedling Disease Section for more information."
,Okra,Virus,": A whitefly-transmitted geminivirus was detected by Dr. Judith K. Brown in okra from Tamaulipas, Mexico (adjacent to the Lower Rio Grande Valley) in the fall of 1994. Fruit has irregular yellow areas which follow a longitudinal alignment. The initial symptom on young leaves is a diffuse, mottled appearance. Older leaves have irregular yellow areas which are interveinal. The disease is associated with the presence of whiteflies. The nature of the geminivirus has not been determined, nor has the presence of other viruses been ruled out. Preliminary experiments by Dr. Brown suggest the virus is not seedborne. There are no control measures. "
,Okra,Cotton Root Rot," (fungus – ,): Infected plants die suddenly from mid-summer to fall. Leaves usually remain attached to the plant. For more information see the , Section."
,Okra,Charcoal Rot," (Fungus – ,): (See section on ,)"
,Okra,Southern Blight," (fungus – ,): (See section on ,)"
,Lettuce,Downy Mildew," (fungus – ,): First symptoms are yellowish or light green areas on the upper surface of the leaves. As the lesions enlarge, the fungus produces downy growth on the underside of the leaf (,). The affected tissue turns brown, sometimes comprising extensive areas of the leaf. Infected leaves are usually invaded by other microorganisms, causing considerable damage during shipping. The fungus is rarely seed-borne and does not persist long in soil. The source of infection is infested crop residue and, occasionally, weeds. Spores of the downy mildew fungus are wind-borne and are carried considerable distances. Symptoms are produced within 5-10 days after infection. Cool, humid weather with rain, heavy dew or fog favors disease development. There are several races of the fungus and varieties differ in their reaction. Resistant varieties may become susceptible when new races of the fungus develop. Varieties resistant to known races should be planted. Preventative fungicide applications at frequent intervals will give satisfactory control of the disease."
,Lettuce,Sclerotinia Drop," (fungus – ,: The cause is a soilborne fungus that infects the stem of lettuce at or near ground level. Lower leaves wilt and collapse, the entire plant wilts and dies (,). Later, a soft, watery, brown rot occurs. A white, cottony growth of the fungus may be found on the surface of leaves and stems (,). Hard, black resting bodies called sclerotia, can be found in the cottony growth. The fungus is soilborne and can remain in the field for several years. Avoid planting in infested fields."
,Lettuce,Mosaic ,"(virus): Young plants first show a slight leaf rolling, followed by light green to yellow mottling. Foliage has a yellowish color and plants are small or dwarfed. Symptoms vary according to type or variety of lettuce. The virus is seed-borne and overwinters in wild hosts and weeds. Infected seed is the most common source of infection. Once infected plants are present in the field, aphids will continue to spread the virus. There is no cure for mosaic once a plant is infected. The control is to use virus-free seed."
,Lettuce,Big Vein ,"(virus): Infection may appear at any stage of growth. Very young seedlings are killed. Surviving plants are smaller in size, the quality of heads is affected and maturity is delayed. Infected leaves have an upright habit of growth. Areas around the veins clear, causing the veins to appear enlarged (,). The virus is transmitted by ,, a soilborne fungus found in the fine roots of many plants. The virus may persist in the fungus in soil for up to eight years. Avoiding excessive soil moisture and rotation are the means of reducing disease losses. Varieties may differ in tolerance."
,Lettuce,Tip Burn," (physiological): Margins of leaves die and turn brown. The first symptoms produced are small, dark brown spots about a quarter of an inch from the edge of the leaf. Tissue around these spots dies and turns brown along the margins. Tip burn usually becomes infected with secondary bacteria, causing soft rot. The disease is believed to be related to fluctuations in soil moisture, drastic changes in temperature, and available calcium. No satisfactory control for this disease has been developed."
,Lettuce,Damping-Off," (fungi – ,sp., ,sp.): Small plants wilt and die soon after emergence. Excessively wet and prolonged cool periods of weather are conducive to damping-off. Use only high quality seed which have been treated with a fungicide. Plantings should be on raised beds."
,Lettuce,Soft Rot," (bacterium – ,): The bacterium enters through mechanical wounds or following damage caused by other diseases, insects or frost. Once the disease is established, it may spread rapidly in the field under warm, wet conditions. There is no practical control of the disease once it becomes established and losses will increase during transit and marketing. Infected or damaged lettuce should not be packed; lettuce waiting to be shipped should be kept refrigerated."
,Lettuce,Nematodes,": (See section on ,)"
,Garlic,,
,English Pea,Powdery Mildew," (fungus – ,): Plants infected with this fungus are covered with a white powdery mold on the leaves, stems and pods. Infected plants are stunted and eventually die. The fungus is seed-borne. Optimum temperatures for development are between 68oF and 75oF. Soils should be kept as dry as possible yet will permit maximum growth. Avoid heavy application of fertilizer and rotate with non-related crops. Powdery mildew is the most serious disease of English peas in Texas."
,English Pea,Bacterial Blight," (bacterium – , pv. ,): The bacterium attacks all parts of the plant. Infected stems become olive brown in color, while the leaflets become yellowish or water-soaked. Young infected pods drop prematurely. Well formed pods become water-soaked. The bacterium is seed-borne. Rain or irrigation water is necessary for movement of the organism. After infection takes place, four to six days is required before lesions are visible. Optimum temperature for development is 82oF. Control of this pathogen is through a combination of practices such as drainage, row spacing, seeding rates, weed control, and restricting irrigation only to that needed for maximum plant growth."
,English Pea,Ascochyta Blight," (fungi – ,): All three fungi are known to attack peas. Affected leaves have spots which are large, pale brown to dark brown in color. Lesions are papery in appearance and have gray to tan centers marked by small black pycnidia. Infection by some species cause purple lesions. On pods, deep lesions are formed which may have purple margins. The center is tan with black pycnidia. Planting infected seed results in poor stands. All three species of fungi are seed borne and carry over in crop residue. Rainfall and heavy dews are necessary for infection. No infection occurs when the relative humidity is below 80%. Optimum temperatures for the fungus are between 68oF and 82oF. Control is achieved by using clean seed, long rotations (four years or longer), planting in well-drained soil, and deep plowing to remove old crop residue."
,English Pea,Aphanomyces Root-Rot," (fungus – ,): Early infection causes complete crop loss due to seedling death. Late infection results in poor plant growth and reduced seed formation. Tissue decay does not develop above the soil line unless the weather is extremely wet. Infection occurs in both wet and dry soils, but is most destructive in wet soils. Optimum temperatures for infection are between 65oF and 75oF. The use of high levels of fertilizer will encourage continued root development. Nitrogen acts as a suppressant to fungal growth. The use of three year rotation, well-drained soil, and the liberal use of fertilizer will help reduce losses from this disease. Mosaic (virus): Irregular, light and dark, greenish areas and puckering occurs in leaves. Control aphids that transmit the virus."
,English Pea,Charcoal Rot:," (See Section on ,)"
,English Pea,Root Knot:," (See ,)"
,Eggplant,Colletotrichum Fruit Rot," (fungus – ,): Lesions on the fruit vary from small spots to one-half inch in diameter. The tissue is sunken, with an area filled with a flesh-colored ooze of fungal spores. Spots vary from one to several on the fruit surface. Severely infected fruit drop to the ground with the pedicel still attached to the plant. The fungus overwinters in plant residue and grows at temperatures of 55oF to 95oF with optimum growth at 80oF. Rainfall and overhead irrigation favor disease development. The fungus develops when the humidity is 93 percent or above. Although field sanitation is important, a preventive fungicide spray program is required during periods favorable for disease development."
,Eggplant,Early Blight," (fungus – ,): This disease can be destructive on eggplant at any time in the life of the plant. It can cause seedling dieback known as collar rot. Later infection is on the foliage beginning on the lower part of the plant and developing upward. Spots are characterized by concentric rings which give a target appearance. Plants which are well fertilized and irrigated are not as susceptible. Infection of the fruit pedicels may cause a premature fruit drop. It requires eight to 10 days after infection before visible symptoms develop to the extent that epidemic levels are reached. Injured fruit are more subject to attack by the fungus than healthy fruit. Infection occurs between 60oF and 90oF. Long rotations, weed control, adequate fertilizer, and irrigation (furrow) will help reduce losses. Use clean seed and follow a thorough spray program when this disease is a problem."
,Eggplant,Leaf Spot and Fruit Rot," (fungus – ,): This disease is characterized by circular brownish spots on fruit and leaves. On the fruit, soft, sunken spots become rotted and shriveled. Spray with approved fungicide beginning when fruit is first set and repeat at 10-day to two week intervals until fruit is nearly mature. Use a three year crop rotation. Florida High Bush, Florida market and Florida Beauty are resistant."
,Eggplant,Wilt ,"(fungus – ,): The pathogen attacks nearly 200 species of plants but eggplant and okra are the two most seriously affected vegetables. Young plants appear normal, but become stunted as they develop. Severely affected plants turn yellow. The lower foliage wilts and defoliation occurs. Symptoms continue to progress until death occurs. When the stem is cut, there is a dark brown, discolored band around the vascular system. Infection occurs directly through the root hairs. The fungus survives for indefinite periods in the soil. Survival is aided by weeds which are susceptible to the fungus. Infection takes place when the temperature ranges from 55oF to 86oF. Verticillium is favored in its development if the soil is alkaline. Some development takes place at pH of 5.0 but all growth is stopped at a pH of 4.0. Control involves the use of long rotations. Cotton gin trash should be avoided or be well composted if used."
,Eggplant,Yellows ,"(Tobacco Ring Spot Virus): The disease causes yellowing and whitening of upper leaves. Later, entire plant becomes yellow and may die. Avoid planting in fields where yellows have occurred and, if warranted, fumigate soil to control nematodes. The dagger nematode is a known vector of the virus."
,Corn (Sweet),Brown Leaf Spot," (fungus – ,): The fungus causing this disease occurs in most fields but seldom does economic damage. Infection requires high temperatures and presence of surface moisture. The first symptom of the disease is small circular spots. As they mature, they turn dark brown. Rotation and deep burial of stalks will help reduce losses to this fungus."
,Corn (Sweet),Charcoal Rot," (fungus – ,): Many plants are susceptible to this soil borne fungus and symptoms vary according to type. Infected stem tissue shows evidence of shredding with tiny black dots (sclerotia) between the remaining tissues. This gives those plant parts an ashy-gray appearance. Stalks such as corn or sorghum show a shredded appearance when split longitudinally. Charcoal rot occurs most consistently when plants are experiencing moisture stress due to drought. The fungus is widely distributed and builds up in soil when susceptible host plants are present and conditions favor its development. Rotation with unrelated crops help reduce the population of the fungus in the soil. Avoid moisture stress by increasing the moisture holding capacity of the soil and, if available, using irrigation when needed. Rotate with crops that are not seriously affected by this organism. Practices which hasten decomposition of crop residue may help decrease the population of the fungus in the soil."
,Corn (Sweet),Common Rust ,"(fungus – ,): Common rust occurs in most home gardens and commercial fields, but seldom causes economic losses. Infected leaves have raised spots or pustules formed primarily on the upper surface. The pustules are rectangular to oval, brick red, and may occur in bands on the leaf (,). Spores are produced in the pustules, which are blown to neighboring leaves where infection can be repeated. Infection is encouraged by high humidity and cool temperatures (60oF to 70oF)."
,Corn (Sweet),Common Smut," (fungus – ,): Common smut is easily found in fields of sweet corn. The fungus overwinters as spores in the soil or in manure. They can survive 2 or 3 years. Spores may be windborne for long distances. Younger plants are more susceptible. Any above-ground part is susceptible. Ears are most commonly infected. Hail provides open wounds and greatly increases infection. Galls are formed as the common smut fungus causes cells of the corn plant to increase in size and number. These galls at first are covered with a thin white membrane. As the gall ages, the membranes break open to reveal a black powdery spore mass underneath (,). The spores are blown to adjoining corn plants where infection in repeated. The smut fungus is favored by high temperatures and high moisture. Optimum spore germination occurs from 79 to 100oF. Little infection occurs below 61oF. Plants grown in soils high in nitrogen or plants damaged through cultivation are most susceptible to infection. Seed treatment is not effective and breeding for resistance has not been successful."
,Corn (Sweet),Corn Stunt," (spiroplasma): Corn stunt occurs in a small percentage in most sweet corn fields. It seldom reaches levels high enough to cause economic loss. The corn stunt spiroplasma is transmitted by leafhoppers. Infected plants are stunted, young leaves are yellow in color, and with age they take on a reddish-purple color. Internodes are reduced in length and infected stalks are sterile. Control is not required due to the very low percentage of plants that normally show this symptom in the field."
,Corn (Sweet),Crazy Top Downy Mildew," (fungus – ,): This disease is a problem when fields become flooded early in the life of the plant. The fungus produces swimming spores which require water for mobility. Infected plants are sterile and have numerous shoots at the base of the stalk. Leaves are thickened, distorted, and a lighter green color than normal leaves. Tassels and ears develop green, leafy shoots. The fungus is commonly found in grasses along the edge of the field. Spores are washed into the field in flood water. Infection of the young corn plants takes place at this time. Varieties vary in their reaction to this fungus. Due to the low percentage of occurrence, little has been done to rate varieties for their reaction. Avoid fields that flood regularly and plant on a raised bed which will help reduce the exposure of young seedlings to standing or flowing water."
,Corn (Sweet),Downy Mildew," (fungus – ,): Infected plants are chlorotic, stunted and have striped leaves. Infected leaves have a downy growth on the underside, toward the basal part. Potential infection is increased when the crop is grown in soil previously grown to infected sorghum, field corn, or sweet corn. Although high populations of spores are produced on the leaf surface, they are short-lived and require extended periods of high humidity for infection. Overwintering spores produced between leaf veins exist in the soil for long periods. Practices which hasten the breakdown of crop residue will help reduce the amount of inoculum carried over in the soil. Varieties vary in their reaction to this disease. Growers should consult their county Extension agent for current hybrids and their reaction to this disease."
,Corn (Sweet),High Plains Disease," (Unknown): This disease is found on the Texas High Plains on corn and wheat. It is suspected to be a virus vectored by the wheat curl mite. Symptoms consist of yellow areas that eventually form yellow bands (,). The earlier the infection the more destructive the disease. Early infected plants are stunted (,). Ears will be reduced in size and partially filled (,). The disease continues throughout the season. Hybrids will differ in susceptibility [,]. Suggested controls for sweet corn include planting early, using resistant hybrids, plowing volunteer wheat, and in general, staying away from grain such as wheat, barley, and rye. Weeds and native grasses that serve as hosts should also be avoided [Yellow Foxtail, Green Foxtail, Stink Grass, Crab Crass, Switch Grass]."
,Corn (Sweet),Maize Dwarf Mosaic, (virus): Maize Dwarf Mosaic virus is the most common virus disease of sweet corn in Texas. Infected plants have mottled upper leaves that are lighter in color than healthy leaves. The mottled or mosaic pattern consists of alternate yellow and green islands in the leaf tissue. Aphids transmit virus particles from surrounding Johnsongrass. Johnsongrass rhizomes serve as the overwintering host for this virus. Early infected plants may be sterile. Late infection will reduce yields and quality of corn produced. Insect control is not successful due to the feeding pattern of the aphid. Elimination of Johnsongrass and isolation of sweet corn fields from Johnsongrass stands will help reduce the occurrence of this disease. There are a number of hybrids of sweet corn that are resistant [see table below].
,Corn (Sweet),Plant Parasitic Nematodes,": (,)"
,Corn (Sweet),Northern Corn Leaf Blight," (fungus – ,): This disease is found in most sweet corn fields in wetter areas of Texas, but it is seldom severe enough to cause economic loss. Spots produced are larger than those caused by the southern corn leafspot fungus. Spots are from one to six inches long and one-half to one inch wide. With maturity, the center of the spot has a dark brown color, usually due to spore production. Infection occurs first on the lower or older foliage (,). High humidity and temperatures between 60oF and 80oF favor disease development. Varieties vary in their reaction to the fungus."
,Corn (Sweet),Seed Rots and Seedling Disease," (fungi – ,spp. , and others): Both seed rots and seedling disease can cause poor stands. In cold soils, seeds decay and seedlings may die before they break the soil surface. In warmer soils, they more commonly emerge, but will have rotted roots and stems at the ground line. Cool wet soils slow seed germination and development of young seedlings so that there is exposure to fungi for a longer period of time. Low quality seed also produce seedlings that are weak and survive poorly in cold wet soils. Control is obtained by using high quality seed which have been treated with protective fungicides. Sweet corn should be planted on a raised bed after the soil temperature is above 55oF."
,Corn (Sweet),Southern Corn Leaf Blight," (fungus – ,): The disease is easy to recognize under field conditions. Spots on the leaves are tan to brown in color. On the ear the fungus causes oblong, bleached spots which penetrate through the shuck layers and finally into the ear. The fungus overwinters in crop residue and produces spores which can be carried for long distances by wind."
,Corn (Sweet),Stalk Rot and Kernel Rot," (fungus – ,spp.): ,fungi survive on corn residue in soil and on seed. Stalk rot is associated with moisture stress and over-fertilization. Cutting the stalk will reveal a pink discoloration of the pith. Infected plants are stunted and delayed in maturity (,). During periods of high wind plants often lodge. The ,stage of the fungus will infect kernels causing them to be pink in color. Infected ears have a strong odor and should not be used as food or feed. Control stalk rots by rotating with non-related crops, planting in well drained soils, and by using treated seed. Avoid excess nitrogen and avoid root pruning when cultivating and injecting fertilizer."
,Corn (Sweet),,
,Corn (Sweet),,
,Cilantro,Leaf Spot," (fungus – ,sp.): Small to medium size spots develop on leaves. They are usually yellowish when young and later (,). The disease is favored by warm, wet weather. Sustained leaf wetness favors infection. Cultural controls include a wide row spacing to permit air circulation so that leaves stay wet for a limited period of time."
,Cilantro,Powdery Mildew," (fungus – ,sp.): Leaves are covered with a fine, white powdery coating. The disease is favored by warm, dry weather. Altering row spacing and row orientation into prevailing wind will allow air to circulate within the crop canopy, reducing the highly humid microclimate that favors disease development."
,Celery,Cercospora Blight," (fungus – ,): Symptoms begin as small, yellowish spots on both sides of the foliage. Spots enlarge quickly changing from yellow to ash-gray with the tissue drying in affected areas. The fungus also attacks leaf petioles and stems. Under conditions of high humidity and warm weather, a gray velvety growth can be seen on the surface of affected spots. The fungus is seed-borne and spores can also be blown in air currents for long distances. Warm temperatures are required for fungus development. Control is obtained by using disease-free seed treated with fungicides and spraying plants with a protective fungicide at regular intervals when disease represents a threat."
,Celery,Late Blight," (fungi – ,): Small, yellowish spots develop on the underside of the leaves which later spread to the entire foliage. Spots enlarge and turn brown, similar to lesions caused by Cercospora. Minute, black fruiting bodies can be found scattered in the affected areas. Lesions with fruiting structures can be seen on petioles and stems. High humidity, free water, and cool temperatures favor disease development. Fungicides recommended for ,blight will also control late blight."
,Celery,Stalk Rot," (fungi – ,): A serious disease of celery that is favored by high temperatures and moist conditions. Symptoms are first seen as small lesions on the base of the petioles, near the ground. As the disease progresses, the spots are enlarged, appear watersoaked at first, turning later to a brick-red color. When matured, the spots are sunken and turn to a dark brown color that is characteristic of the disease. The lesion can be a few or numerous, making it necessary to trim a lot of the leaves, thus reducing quality and yield. Shallow planting on raised beds and fungicide applications serve to reduce disease losses."
,Celery,Root Knot," (nematode – ,spp.): (,)"
,Carrot,Aster Yellows," (Mycoplasma): The first symptom of aster yellows is yellowing of the foliage (,) followed by excessive growth and bunching of shoots. Older leaves become twisted and may fall off. Leaves later have a bronzed appearance (,). Roots are misshapen, and are of poor quality with a proliferation of adventitious roots (,). This organism is transmitted by leafhoppers. weeds in and surrounding the crop can serve as a reservoir for this pathogen. The disease usually occurs sporadically with little economic loss."
,Carrot,Black Root Rot," (fungus – ,): This is primarily a post-harvest problem, although soil is the source of the pathogen. Black, irregular areas are seen on the roots. (,) Physical injury predisposes carrots to infection, but disease can be minimized by washing soil from them, cooling them as quickly as possible to at least 45o, and by rinsing them in chlorinated water before placing them in bags."
,Carrot,Cotton Root Rot ,"(fungus – ,: Carrots are usually grown during cooler times of the year when this fungus is not active and so, they escape this disease. In geographic areas where this pathogen is present, the disease can be seen later in the spring on carrots growing in lighter soils, particularly following an irrigation. Areas of dead and wilted plants are seen in a field (,). These resemble the dead areas that can also be caused by the southern blight fungus, but there is no fungal growth on the surface of the soil  (,). When carrots are pulled out, they are not rotted and a sheath of soil clings to them (,). When this soil is removed, infection cushions and mycelial strands of the fungus can be seen on the surface of the carrot (,). A microscopic examination for the the characteristic cruciform hyphal branching will confirm the diagnosis. Planning for an earlier harvest will prevent disease losses."
,Carrot,Damping-off," (fungi- ,, etc.): Like many other vegetables, carrot seedlings are susceptible to several species of soilborne fungi, particularly during the periods of cool, wet weather. Infected seedlings wilt, turn brown and die, resulting in poor stands. To prevent damping-off, seeds should be planted on a bed to allow for drainage. Seedlings should not be overwatered."
,Carrot,Growth Crack," (physiological): The length of the carrot is split (,). This is caused mainly by fluctuating soil moisture throughout the growing season. If there is a high incidence in a field, then carrots should be watered more regularly to prevent wide moisture fluctuations."
,Carrot,Leaf Blight," (fungus – ,) Infection occurs mostly on older leaves, but younger leaves may also become infected. Leaf blight first appears as indefinite brown to black areas with pale yellow centers (,). Infected leaves shrivel when infection is heavy. Under these conditions foliage appears as if burned by fire (,). The fungus overwinters in infected crop refuse. Air-borne spores of the fungus are produced in large numbers on old lesions during periods of high humidity. Spores may also be carried on seed. The fungus requires moisture on leaves for infection. A preventative fungicide program should be followed where the disease is normally present, using a spray interval of 10 to 14 days."
,Carrot,Leaf Spot," (fungus – ,): This disease may occur at any position on the leaf but is most common on margins. Spots are circular in shape and, with age, they coalesce to form larger spots. Lesions on the leaves are, sometimes surrounded by a lighter-colored halo. Lesions on the petioles are enlongated with a pale center and dark margin. Spots on the petiole may encircle it causing defoliation. Leaf spot is distinguished from leaf blight by the nearly circular, sharply defined lesions with a yellow halo. The disease usually occurs during the latter part of the growing season and can be controlled with the same fungicide program as used for leaf blight."
,Carrot,Powdery Mildew," (fungus – ,): This disease is not usually serious. The surface of affected leaves are covered by a white mass of the fungus, which has a powdery texture (,). Symptoms may also be found on petioles. Fungicide applications at 10 to 14 day intervals will control the disease."
,Carrot,Root Knot Nematode," (nematode – ,spp.): There are no diagnostic symptoms seen on above-ground plant parts. When infected carrots are examinged, galls can be seen on adventitious roots and there is often multiple tap-root formation (,) or malformed roots (,). Although deformed carrots are culled at the packing shed, nematodes contained in the roots are not harmful to humans when consumed. A soil test for nematodes can be done before planting to determine the potential for a problem. Pre-plant nematicides can be used where the soil is infested. Nematode populations in soil can also be reduced with a weed-free fallow or by rotation with cereals."
,Carrot,Southern Blight," (fungus – ,): This disease occurs close to harvest and is associated with warm temperatures that follow heavy rains. Plants die in clusters within a field. A bright, white mycelium is found on the surface of the soil, along with spherical, tan resting bodies of the fungus that resemble a mustard seed (,). By the time the fungus is seen on the surface of the soil, the carrot is rotted. There are no control recommendations. Harvesting should be done as quickly as possible in affected fields. Harvested carrots should be processed and cooled as quickly as possible to minimize post- harvest decay caused by the fungus."
,"Cantaloupe, Cucumber, Squash, Pumpkin and Crenshaw",Alternaria Leaf Spot," – (fungus – ,): Small, circular watersoaked spots first appear on the leaves, later enlarging to one and one-half inch or more in diameter. Definite concentric rings and margins appear giving the diseased area a “bull’s eye” appearance. The fungus overwinters in crop residue and on other cucurbit plants. Numerous air-borne spores are produced on diseased spots. Crop rotation and seed treatment help. A preventative fungicide [see section below] program should be followed when the disease occurs consistently. (See Photo of ,)"
,"Cantaloupe, Cucumber, Squash, Pumpkin and Crenshaw",Angular Leaf Spot," – (bacterium – , pv. ,): This disease appears on leaves, stems and fruit. Spots are small, angular, straw-colored and watersoaked. Leaf spots often dry and fall out giving the leaf a “shot-hole” appearance, similar to those caused by anthracnose. Spots on fruit are usually smaller and circular in shape. Bacteria overwinter in crop residue and on seed. Hard rains splash the bacteria to stems and leaves. The disease may reach epidemic proportions during periods of heavy rains, particularly if temperatures remain high. Crop rotation with non-cucurbit crops is helpful for control of angular leaf spot. Application of copper fungicide will assist in control. Cucurbits, however, are sensitive to copper when young, and repeated applications of copper may cause yellowing of foliage around the edges of the leaves. See fungicide [,]"
,"Cantaloupe, Cucumber, Squash, Pumpkin and Crenshaw",Anthracnose ,"– (fungus – ,): First symptoms are spots on the foliage that begin as yellowish or watersoaked areas. Spots enlarge and turn brown to black in color. Diseased tissue dries and the center of the spots fall out, giving the leaf a “shot-hole” appearance. Symptoms on fruits consist of circular, black, sunken, cankers varying in size depending on the host plant. When abundant moisture is present, the center of the spot is surrounded by a gelatinous pink mass. The fungus overwinters on old cucurbit vines and residues. It may also be seed-borne. Plants may be infected at any stage of growth. Disease appearance in the field depends mainly on rainy, cool weather for a period of several days. All above ground portions may be infected. Seed treatment, crop rotation and destruction of crop residues are important practices for the control of this disease. Preventative fungicide applications, as recommended for downy mildew control, should be made if weather conditions are favorable for disease development. Preventative fungicide [,] applications will protect plants against infection."
,"Cantaloupe, Cucumber, Squash, Pumpkin and Crenshaw",Charcoal Rot," – (fungus – ,): Symptoms resemble those of gummy-stem blight and other vine diseases of melons. First symptoms are dying of leaves close to the crown. As the disease progresses, entire runners wilt and die. Close observation of the crown will reveal brown cankers on the stems both below and above the soil line. Black, hard bodies produced by the fungus, known as sclerotia, are found on the surface of the cankers. Crop rotation may be of limited use since the fungus affects a large number of hosts, including corn and grain sorghum. Dry conditions are normally associated with charcoal rot."
,"Cantaloupe, Cucumber, Squash, Pumpkin and Crenshaw",Choanephora Wet-Rot," – (fungus – ,): This disease occurs almost exclusively on crenshaw, squash and pumpkins. The blossom ends of fruit turn black, watersoaked, and covered by a fungal growth. The fungus is usually confined to the end of the fruit, but if conditions favorable for disease development prevail, the entire fruit may decay. Greatest damage by this disease is caused during prolonged damp weather."
,"Cantaloupe, Cucumber, Squash, Pumpkin and Crenshaw",Downy Mildew," – (fungus – ,): Angular yellow spots appear on the upper surface of the leaf during periods of high humidity. The underside of leaves, opposite the yellow spots, becomes covered with grayish growth which is the spore producing structures of the fungus. This growth is more noticeable early in the morning when heavy dew is present. Spores are easily carried by wind from diseased plants. Cool temperatures along with free moisture are ideal for mildew infection and spread. Hot, dry weather may reduce or stop disease development. Resistant varieties should be used when possible. Preventative fungicide [,] applications should begin at bloom and continue until the crop is harvested. (See Photo of ,)"
,"Cantaloupe, Cucumber, Squash, Pumpkin and Crenshaw",Fusarium Rind Rot," – (fungus – ,): Rind rot is mainly a cantaloupe disease. Rots appear on the melon rind which at first may go unnoticed. However, after peeling the fruit, large brown decomposed areas may be found in the flesh. Since the disease may go unnoticed in the field, melons may be harvested, packed and shipped without the handlers being aware of the problem."
,"Cantaloupe, Cucumber, Squash, Pumpkin and Crenshaw",Fusarium Wilt," – (fungus – , f. sp. ,): Fungus infects roots causing damping-off of seedlings or wilting and plant death of older plants. Brown streaks may be visible on runners near the crown. Internally, roots have a honey brown discoloration, especially in the vascular elements. Resistant varieties and 4-5 year rotations are recommended for control."
,"Cantaloupe, Cucumber, Squash, Pumpkin and Crenshaw",Gummy Stem Blight," – (fungus – ,): This fungus infects leaves and stems, and is more prominent in the crown at soil level. Leaf symptoms begin with irregular spots that dry and drop out giving the lesion a ragged appearance. The most conspicuous phase of the disease is the brown exudation in the crown of infected plants. Vine cankers are found near the soil line, producing a gummy brown ooze. The fungus overwinters in the soil and on crop residue. The fungus is seed-borne. Once the fungus becomes established, millions of spores are produced which can be readily disseminated to other plants by rain, wind or mechanical equipment. Crop rotation should be practiced. Spraying with fungicide [,] has also shown to be effective."
,"Cantaloupe, Cucumber, Squash, Pumpkin and Crenshaw",Monosporasus Root Rot," – (fungus – ,): Foliage begins to yellow as plants near maturity. Leaves dieback progressively from the crown outward and plants die prematurely. The taproot is usually necrotic with brownish discoloration in the vascular tissues. The fungus reproduces on small secondary roots. Perithecia (small black spherical structures) of the fungus can be seen on secondary host if plants are carefully dug from soil. Rotation and soil fumigation are effective controls. No resistant varieties are known. Monosporasus root rot is primarily a disease on cantaloupe."
,"Cantaloupe, Cucumber, Squash, Pumpkin and Crenshaw",Powdery Mildew," – (fungus – , and ,): Disease appears on leaves as a white powdery mass composed of the spore-bearing structures of the fungus. The disease can affect entire fields. Severely infected leaves shrivel and die. The fungus can also grow on petioles and young stems. Infected plants are yellow, stunted, and may die. Fruits are not attacked, but are usually small and deformed. Powdery mildew is favored by cool, dry weather. Spores are air-borne. For most cucurbits there are resistant varieties. Preventative fungicide [,] applications will effectively control powdery mildew. New races of the fungus have appeared which are resistant to some fungicides. Several applications may be necessary for optimum control. (See Photo of ,)"
,"Cantaloupe, Cucumber, Squash, Pumpkin and Crenshaw",Root Knot Nematodes," – (nematode – ,spp.): Root knot nematodes are microscopic sized worms that infect roots, causing a cancer-like growth. Knots or galls on the roots prevent normal nutrient and water uptake. (See Photo of ,) Controls include chemical and cultural practices. Resistant varieties are not available. "

Prune out  infected twigs and spray in early spring with an approved fixed copper  fungicide."
,Willow,Crown Gal,"l (bacterium – ,):  Mainly a nursery disease. Large, rough, woody swellings or galls on the  lower part of the stem and crown of the plant. Infected plants may be  deformed, stunted or even killed. Weeping willow is susceptible. No  practical control is known for this disease."
,Willow,Cytospora Canker," (fungus – , sp.): Affects willows the same as poplars. Discolored, sunken, often  sharply defined areas develop on twigs, branches or trunk.

,Cultural Practices for Reducing Crop Diseases,,
,Cultural Practices for Reducing Crop Diseases,Rotation with unrelated crops," is probably the most utilized cultural practice for disease control.  This helps keep populations of pathogens from building up to damaging  numbers. One should not expect rotation to eliminate disease  development, but it certainly aids in reducing damage from most  diseases."
,Cultural Practices for Reducing Crop Diseases,Fertilizer usage," may have some bearing on  development of certain diseases. It differs with each crop and each  disease but, in general, nitrogen out of balance with other nutrients  enhances foliage disease development and predisposes some plants to  other diseases. Potash, on the other hand, helps reduce disease  development when it is in balance with other elements."
,Cultural Practices for Reducing Crop Diseases,Deep burial of crop residue, helps control certain diseases by placing the organism contained in the  residue at a depth where there is an oxygen deficiency. This reduces  the population of the disease-causing organism and permits the crop to  escape much of the damage.
,Cultural Practices for Reducing Crop Diseases,Planting on a raised bed," is  helpful in preventing certain diseases such as Southern blight and  certain of the wilt diseases. This practice is advisable when growing  leguminous crops such as peanuts, soybeans, and guar, and when growing  vegetable crops in tight, poorly drained soils."
,Cultural Practices for Reducing Crop Diseases,Burning of crop residue," has been discouraged because of destruction of valuable organic matter  and creation of an air pollution problem. The fact remains, however,  that it is a highly effective means of eradicating some disease-causing  organisms associated with crop residue."
,Cultural Practices for Reducing Crop Diseases,Time of seeding, has  an important bearing on disease prevention in many cases. Delayed  planting of wheat will help escape the chances of wheat streak mosaic  virus. Early spring planting of cotton may effectively help escape  cotton root rot.
,Cultural Practices for Reducing Crop Diseases,Removal of undesirable plants," that might serve as a host  reservoir for virus diseases that attack cultivated crops aid in  preventing infection. Infected rhizomes of Johnsongrass are the primary  overwintering host for the maize dwarf mosaic virus that attacks grain  sorghum, forage sorghum, and corn. Wild Solanaceae weeds, such as  jimsonweed, horsenettel and silverleaf nightshade harbor viruses that  attack potato and tomato."
,Cultural Practices for Reducing Crop Diseases,Volunteer plants, from a harvested  crop are often means of carrying a disease organism from one crop  season to the next. Rusts of cereal crops and spinach constitute an  example of this type disease dissemination.
,Cultural Practices for Reducing Crop Diseases,Roguing (removal) of diseased plants, as they appear is often an effective method in helping reduce the  spread of a destructive disease. Virus diseases of stone fruits and  bacterial wilt of cucurbits are examples where roguing is worthy of  consideration.

,Non-Chemical Control of Plant Diseases in the Home Garden,,
,Non-Chemical Control of Plant Diseases in the Home Garden,This discussion is limited to diseases where a pathogen is involved.," Most plant problems arising from environmental conditions are covered  under such topics as fertilization, water management and other cultural  procedures."
,Non-Chemical Control of Plant Diseases in the Home Garden,,
,Non-Chemical Control of Plant Diseases in the Home Garden,Rotation:," Vegetables in the same family group are more likely to be susceptible to  the same soil-borne diseases. Cantaloupes and watermelons, for example,  have common diseases. If they follow each other in a rotation, a  disease organism may be limited on the first crop but sustain enough  carry-over in the soil to cause severe loss on the following crop.  Vegetables from different family groups should be rotated because they  are usually not susceptible to the same disease organisms. The groups  listed below should be rotated so a selection from one group is not  planted in the same location more than once every 2 to 3 years. Limited  garden space may prevent an ideal rotation system."
,Non-Chemical Control of Plant Diseases in the Home Garden,Organic Matter:," Organic matter increases the  number and kind of microorganisms in the soil. Many of these  microorganisms compete with disease agents for nourishment. In most  cases, the best organic matter is obtained by turning under a green  cover crop, such as a small grain (wheat, oats, barley, cereal rye) or a  legume."
,Non-Chemical Control of Plant Diseases in the Home Garden,Resistant Varieties:," Agricultural  scientists have made great strides in developing disease-resistant  varieties. Resistance, however, is a relative term and does not indicate  immunity. For example, a tomato plant resistant to Fusarium wilt may  develop wilt if stressed but not become diseased to the degree that a  susceptible variety might. Resistance could be expressed as slower  disease development which allows resistant plants to produce an  acceptable yield before or without losing vigor to disease attack."
,Non-Chemical Control of Plant Diseases in the Home Garden,Sanitation:," Any crop residue destruction practice that reduces the disease agent’s  ability to reproduce or overseason could be included under sanitation.  Examples are raking and burning diseased leaves and disposing of  infected fruit. Root knot nematode-infested plants should be dug and as  much of the root system as possible removed from the garden site. Root  knot nematodes are harder to kill when protected by root tissue.  Diseased leaves, fruits, and other plant parts should not be piled near  the garden. Fungi, for instance, often produce thousands of spores in  the reproductive process, and these spores can be wind-blown great  distances. Diseased plant tissue should be buried, burned, or disposed  of in some other way that prevents the dispersal of the disease agent.  In most cases, it is best not to put diseased plant parts in a compost  pile. This is especially true for nematode-infected plants. Although  many disease organisms are destroyed by heat during composting, 100  percent kill is not normally obtained. Contaminated compost will only  serve to spread disease organisms as the compost is being used. Compost  for the garden could be made with grass clippings or shrubs and tree  leaves, as the disease organisms on grass and leaves are not likely to  affect garden plants."
,Non-Chemical Control of Plant Diseases in the Home Garden,"Heat Treatment:,
"," Heating small amounts of soil is  practical for potted plants and for growing seedling transplants. The  soil should be moist but not saturated. Heat the soil at 180,F  for approximately 3 hours in a standard oven. An average-sized Irish  potato placed in the middle of the soil can act as an indicator. When it  is cooked, the soil should be sterile. Microwave ovens have also been  used for sterilizing small quantities. Using high power, heat the soil  for 3 minutes. Do not overheat using either system. Excessive heating  will release certain elements in the soil to toxic levels. A new heating  approach called solar pasteurization or solarization was developed in  Israel. It simply consists of covering well tilled, moist soil with  clear plastic, sealing the edges, and leaving it for several weeks.  Black plastic should not be used because soil heating will not be as  great as heating under clear plastic. The best results are with fungi,  principally those causing root rots. Certain weeds and nematodes are  also controlled but not on a consistent basis. Solar pasteurization will  work best during the hottest months. August should be ideal for home  garden sites. For best results leave soil covered 30 days."
,Non-Chemical Control of Plant Diseases in the Home Garden,Fallowing:," Leaving land idle and clean through the growing season will reduce  disease agents in the soil. Fallowing is especially helpful if done in  the summer months when soil temperatures are high. Frequent plowing will  keep the soil dry and free of plant growth and expose soil-borne  disease organisms, such as nematodes, to killing heat and excessive  drying. Other benefits of fallowing are weed and insect control. This  practice is most efficient if rainfall is low and temperatures are high."
,Non-Chemical Control of Plant Diseases in the Home Garden,Weed Control:, Weeds harbor insects and serve as hosts for many virus diseases. For  most viruses to survive they must remain in a living organism whether it  be a host plant or insect. Destroying weeds in and around the garden  may eliminate potential overwintering host plants.
,Non-Chemical Control of Plant Diseases in the Home Garden,"Change Planting Date:,Obtain Disease-Free Planting Stock:,Cultural practices:"," Some diseases can be controlled by changing the planting date.  Spring-planted squash usually escapes mosaic virus, whereas fall-planted  squash does not. Warm-season vegetables, like peas and okra, should be  planted after soils warm sufficiently to avoid seedling disease.,
, It is advisable to check transplants such as cabbage, tomatoes,  peppers, and others for root knot nematode galls. Certified Irish seed  potatoes are less likely to harbor a disease such as black leg. Some  disease agents are seed transmitted; thus, only the best seed should be  planted.,

,Southern Blight,,
,Southern Blight,Disease development:," Southern blight is especially destructive on crops such as tomato, beans, peas and peanuts. Many other plants including annual ornamentals are also susceptible. The fungus develops rapidly during hot weather when temperatures are over 85°F. It grows on living and non-living organic matter and becomes most severe when dead leaves or other types of organic matter are present around the base of the plant. This permits the fungus to build up momentum by utilizing energy from the decaying organic matter and rapidly kill the host plant. The fungus develops rapidly when summer rains occur after a drought. A good rule of thumb is that the first moisture event (either rainfall or irrigation) following the first sustained 3-5 day period when temperatures exceed 95 °F will signal the first sever outbreak of the disease. This stimulates germination of the sclerotia (seed-like structures) and furnishes needed moisture for fungal growth. If the fungus finds ample organic matter and host plants, a large supply of sclerotia are produced for next year. These structures have a hard thick covering that resists weathering."
,Southern Blight,Control:," Southern blight can be controlled with cultural and chemical techniques. Residue management options differ depending on what the previous crop was in a field. If the previous crop was a non susceptible crop in the grass family it my be advantageous to simply mulch the residue into the surface or plant in the stubble. However, if the previous crop was a susceptible one such as peanut, cantaloupe, or black eye pea, residue should be buried deep enough to prevent its being brought back up in land preparation and cultivation. The fungus requires oxygen for development and deep burial reduces its activity. Keeping fallen leaves or other organic matter from the base of the plant is helpful. Using foliage fungicides to prevent foliage diseases will help keep leaves on the plant and off the ground. Fungicides may also be applied to the soil on certain crops. This will inhibit development of the fungus. Planting on a slightly raised bed helps reduce damage on some crops."
,Sooty Mold,Sooty Mold," (fungi – , spp., , spp.,  and others): Sooty mold is a name commonly given to a condition that is  not truly a disease, but a black coating on leaves, branches and fruit  made up of fungal growth. The fungus is usually dark colored and  powdery-like, hence the name sooty mold. The fungi associated with this  condition are saprophytic, that is, they do not feed on live plant  tissue, but rather thrive on insect secretions with a high content of  sugars. These secretions, known as honeydew, are particularly common  with aphids, scales, white flies, and other insects. The insect honeydew  provides nourishment for the fungus, and under proper conditions, the  entire plant may be covered with the sooty mold."

,Plants That Grow on Other Plants,Ball Moss," (plant – ,):  Ball moss has caused concern among homeowners in the southwest part of  Texas for many years. Ball moss is an epiphyte. It grows on the bark of a  number of Texas shade trees; live oak, post oak, hackberry, tallow,  cedar, and others. It first occurs as small, gray green tufts that  develop within a relatively short time into a dense “ball” composed of  numerous individual plants. The plants form root-like holdfasts which  penetrate into the rough bark of the tree. These holdfasts often  completely encircle a limb. Spread is by windblown seeds which are  produced on 3 to 4 inch long stalks. The seed are light and are covered  with a fluffy material which aids in their movement. Within the last few  years, the plant has been spreading eastward from its former Southwest  Texas habitat."
,Plants That Grow on Other Plants,,
,Plants That Grow on Other Plants,Spanish Moss," (plant – ,):  This long, whisker-like plant growth hangs from trees in Southeast and  East Texas. It is an epiphyte. It grows on hardwoods and conifers along  rivers and creeks in the more humid areas of Texas. It is a member of  the pineapple family (,). It has been reported to kill  trees where development is extensive. This seldom occurs. It can be  removed using mechanical means where growth becomes thick enough to  cause tree damage. Chemical treatments are not recommended."
,Plants That Grow on Other Plants,Mistletoe," (parasitic plants – , var. ,, , var. ,, , var. ,, ,var. ,, , var. ,, ,):  Mistletoes are parasitic plants which derive their food from the host  plant. In severe cases mistletoe will kill trees. The seeds of mistletoe  are borne as white fruit on female plants. These berries are sticky and  are spread by birds. The seed germinate and penetrate young, thin bark.  As the seed germinate, a haustorium is formed which penetrates the  cambium and eventually on into the wood. Infection often causes large  swellings to be formed around the point of entry."
,Plants That Grow on Other Plants,,
,Plants That Grow on Other Plants,Lichens,": A lichen is a combination of a fungus  and a green or blue-green alga enclosed by the fungal hyphae. The fungus  obtains food from the alga, which manufactures food through  photosynthesis and the alga receives some of its food and protection  from the fungus. Three forms of lichens exist – crustose (flat type of  growth), foliose (leaf-like but with prostrate growth), and fruticose  (bush-like and erect or hanging growth). The effect of lichens on trees  is only slightly damaging. Heavy lichen growth indicates poor tree  growth as a result of some other cultural problem. Lichens can restrict  gas exchange from the limb or twig and can restrict the amount of light  received by a limb."

,Mycotoxins,Blacklight,": Corn contaminated with kernels infected with , will often produce a characteristic bright greenish-yellow flourescence  (BGYF) when examined in a darkened room under long wave ultraviolet  light or what is commonly called a blacklight. This fluorescence is the  result of the properties of Kojic acid. Kojic acid is another compound  produced by ,; it is not related directly to aflatoxin.  The blacklight test is a presumptive test and assumes aflatoxin is  present if the presence of Kojic acid indicates that , is  present. Blacklight positive samples usually contain some aflatoxin but  this method cannot determine if the load exceeds the F.D.A. Guideline  of 20 ppb. If a load of corn is found to be positive with a blacklight  test, it is recommended that a representative sample of this lot be  taken and a determinative test such as a minicolumn or other test be  performed."
,Mycotoxins,Minicolumn Test or Holiday Minicolumn Test,": The  minicolumn test is a determinative test for aflatoxins. It is rapid,  relatively inexpensive and can be performed at the buying point. This  test is commonly employed to determine if corn exceeds the FDA Guideline  of 20 ppb. If the sample used for analysis is representative of the  entire load, it is an acceptable method for determining whether to  accept or reject loads."
,Mycotoxins,Thin-Layer Chromatography (TLC),":  The thin layer chromatography method for determining aflatoxin is a more  precise measure of determining aflatoxin concentrations in corn. If  this method is coupled with AOAC (Association of Official Analytical  Chemists) approved extraction methods, it is superior to other methods  of quantitating aflatoxins. This method is commonly employed by testing  laboratories."
,Mycotoxins,Rapid Test Kits,": Recently, several commercial firms have marketed  rapid test kits for use in determining the aflatoxin concentration in  corn samples. These test kits are self contained and provide all the  necessary instructions to complete an analyses on-farm, at the elevator,  or at the buying point. Several kits are available at varying prices  (ranging from $5-15/test depending on quantity ordered). The following  table includes sources for 3 such test kits."

,Mycotoxins,Detoxification,":  Several compounds are under investigation for detoxification of  aflatoxins from corn. One such method being examined in southeastern  states is use of anhydrous ammonia. This method has shown some promise  in feed corn, but problems with feed refusal have limited its use. Also,  kernel discoloration results from this method, and this has prohibited  its use in food grain corn."
,Mycotoxins,Blending,": The physical mixing  of contaminated (greater than 20 ppb) corn with uncontaminated (less  than 20 ppb) corn is not a recommended practice. While occasionally  successful, too often the result is a larger lot of contaminated corn.  Efforts to separate and work with contaminated lots through screening or  alternative usage will give the most consistent and desirable results  in marketing contaminated corn."
,Mycotoxins,Screening,": The use of small  opening screens has resulted in successfully reducing the aflatoxin  concentration in food grade or other high value corn. Screening removes  broken kernels which often contain a high percentage of the aflatoxin  contamination. Screening has been coupled with the use of vibrator or  gravity tables which remove any light-weight, infected kernels and thus  further reduce the aflatoxin concentration in food grade corn. Screening  corn can significantly reduce the aflatoxin concentration in corn with  only a minimal (5 to 10 percent) loss in grain weight or yield."

,Cotton Root Rot,Disease Symptoms," – Symptoms are most likely to occur from June through September when soil temperatures reach 28 °C (82 °F). The first symptoms are slight yellowing or bronzing of the leaves. The upper-most leaves wilt within 24 to 48 hours after bronzing, followed by wilting of the lower leaves within 72 hours. Permanent wilt occurs by the third day, followed by death. The leaves remain firmly attached to the plant. Affected plants die suddenly, often after excellent growth. Trees and shrubs may die more slowly."

,Cotton Root Rot,Causal Organisms," – , exists in the soil in three distinct forms:"
,Cotton Root Rot,Control ,"– Cotton root rot is one of the most difficult plant diseases to control. Fungal behavior in different crops, soils and from year to year in the same field are so erratic that several approaches should be used."
,Cotton Root Rot,Landscape ,– A list of ornamental plants with some resistance to cotton root rot is found in Bulletin L-2056.
,Cotton Root Rot,Rotation,. Research shows that rotations of 3 or 4 years with a monocotyledonous crop have reduced disease incidence up to 60 percent on cotton in some instances. Shorter rotations are less effective.
,Cotton Root Rot,Organic amendments,". Significant control of cotton root rot has been achieved by using residues of various crops. A delay in infection of cotton is readily apparent and has resulted in up to 90 percent reduction in root rot. Wheat, oats, and other cereal crops are effective in delaying infection and reducing losses when incorporated in soil in the spring before cotton is planted."
,Cotton Root Rot,Deep plowing,. Use of a moldboard plow to flat break infested areas 6 to 10 inches deep has markedly reduced the incidence of disease. Flat breaking immediately after cotton harvest reduces the strands’ ability to form sclerotia. The upper 6 inches of soil should thus have a reduced sclerotia level where 90 percent of the roots of a cotton plant are found.
,Cotton Root Rot,Plant barriers,. This technique consists of planting a resistant grass crop such as sorghum around an infected area in a field. These barriers either exclude or limit the spread of disease within the field.
,Cotton Root Rot,Fertilizer applications.," When nitrogen is applied as ammonia in a manner to fumigate as much soil as possible, root rot may be reduced. Early plant maturity. A successful technique for cotton is to plant early maturing varieties, such as TAMCOT CAMD-E, TAMCOT SP37H and TAMCOT CAB-CS, as early as possible in the season so that the crops reach maturity before the plant is killed by the disease. Disease activity increases from June through August; therefore, complete production as early as possible."

,Chemical Damage: Phototoxicity,Symptoms:," Browning or yellowing of the leaf margins and  brownish or discolored irregular areas on leaves are common symptoms of  chemical burns. Severe injury may be evidenced by distortion of new  leaves, or defoliation, but unless some serious mistake has been made,  spray or dust injury is not an important consideration. Pesticides in  emulsifiable formulations are more likely to cause foliage burn than  wettable powders, particularly when combined with wettable powders."
,Chemical Damage: Phototoxicity,Copper,":  Stone fruits are sensitive to copper. Bordeaux mixture causes russeting  of apples and may stunt cantaloupe and watermelon leaves. Copper  compounds should be used with caution on any cucurbit crop. Injury is  most likely to occur when materials are applied to wet leaves and under  damp, slow-drying conditions. Copper containing sprays will also  defoliate peaches, plums and apricots."
,Chemical Damage: Phototoxicity,Zinc Sulfate,: This causes severe defoliation of fruit trees and should not be included in fruit sprays.
,Chemical Damage: Phototoxicity,Sulfur,:  Frequent applications of sulfur may cause light foliage burn on rose  and tender foliaged ornamentals when temperatures exceed 85°F. Sulfur  should not be used on cucurbit crops such as squash and cucumbers.
,Chemical Damage: Phototoxicity,Insecticides,:  Injury to plants may occur when materials are improperly applied or  applied under adverse environmental conditions. Foliage burn is most  likely to occur when materials are applied to wet foliage or when  extremely high temperatures follow application.
,Chemical Damage: Phototoxicity,Herbicides,:  Severe injury to foliage may result from spraying plants with equipment  contaminated by previous use with hormone type herbicides. Common  symptoms are severe growth abnormalities of leaves and leaf roll. Some  herbicides are taken up by plant roots and cause a marginal burn. This  burn develops inward to the veins of the leaf as the material is  concentrated. Defoliation eventually occurs. New leaves are then formed  which may also burn and defoliate. This will continue until the plant  either dies or the chemical is no longer present in a toxic level in the  root zone. Equipment used to apply herbicides should be well marked and  should not be used for disease or insect control purposes. Some trees  and certain ornamentals are sensitive to herbicides that are blended  with fertilizers.
